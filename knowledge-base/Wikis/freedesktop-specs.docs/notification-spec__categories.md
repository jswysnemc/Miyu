## 6 Categories

Notifications can optionally have a type indicator. Although neither client or nor server must support this, some may choose to. Those servers implementing categories may use them to intelligently display the notification in a certain way, or group notifications of similar types.

Categories are in *`class.specific`* form. `class` specifies the generic type of notification, and `specific` specifies the more specific type of notification.

If a specific type of notification does not exist for your notification, but the generic kind does, a notification of type *`class`* is acceptable.

Third parties, when defining their own categories, should discuss the possibility of standardizing on the hint with other parties, preferably in a place such as the [xdg (http://freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/xdg)](http://freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/xdg) mailing list at [freedesktop.org (http://freedesktop.org/)](http://freedesktop.org/). If it warrants a standard, it will be added to the table above. If no consensus is reached, the category should be in the form of "`x-`*`vendor`*`.`*`class`*`.`*`name`*."

The following table lists standard notifications as defined by this spec. More will be added in time.
