## 8 Hints

Hints are a way to provide extra data to a notification server that the server may be able to make use of.

Neither clients nor notification servers are required to support any hints. Both sides should assume that hints are not passed, and should ignore any hints they do not understand.

Third parties, when defining their own hints, should discuss the possibility of standardizing on the hint with other parties, preferably in a place such as the [xdg (http://freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/xdg)](http://freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/xdg) mailing list at [freedesktop.org (http://freedesktop.org/)](http://freedesktop.org/). If it warrants a standard, it will be added to the table above. If no consensus is reached, the hint name should be in the form of `"x-`*`vendor`*`-`*`name`*`."`

The value type for the hint dictionary in D-BUS is of the `DBUS_TYPE_VARIANT` container type. This allows different data types (string, integer, boolean, etc.) to be used for hints. When adding a dictionary of hints, this type must be used, rather than putting the actual hint value in as the dictionary value.

The following table lists the standard hints as defined by this specification. Future hints may be proposed and added to this list over time. Once again, implementations are not required to support these.
