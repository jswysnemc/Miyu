# Ssh Keyscan

is a utility for gathering the public SSH host keys of a number of hosts. It was designed to aid in building and verifying

files, the format of which is documented in

provides a minimal interface suitable for use by shell and perl scripts.

uses non-blocking socket I/O to contact as many hosts as possible in parallel, so it is very efficient. The keys from a domain of 1,000 hosts can be collected in tens of seconds, even when some of those hosts are down or do not run

For scanning, one does not need login access to the machines that are being scanned, nor does the scanning process involve any encryption.

Hosts to be scanned may be specified by hostname, address or by CIDR network range (e.g. 192.168.16/28). If a network range is specified, then all addresses in that range will be scanned.

The options are as follows:

Force

to use IPv4 addresses only.

Force

to use IPv6 addresses only.

Request certificates from target hosts instead of plain keys.

Print keys found as SSHFP DNS records. The default is to print keys in a format usable as an

file.

Read hosts or

pairs from

one per line. If

is supplied instead of a filename,

will read from the standard input. Names read from a file must start with an address, hostname or CIDR network range to be scanned. Addresses and hostnames may optionally be followed by comma-separated name or address aliases that will be copied to the output. For example:

192.168.11.0/24 10.20.1.1 happy.example.org 10.0.0.1,sad.example.org

Hash all hostnames and addresses in the output. Hashed names may be used normally by

and

but they do not reveal identifying information should the file's contents be disclosed.

Specify a key/value option. At present, only a single option is supported:

Selects a hash algorithm to use when printing SSHFP records using the

flag. Valid algorithms are

and

The default is to print both.

Connect to

on the remote host.

Quiet mode: do not print server host name and banners in comments.

Set the timeout for connection attempts. If

seconds have elapsed since a connection was initiated to a host or since the last time anything was read from that host, the connection is closed and the host in question considered unavailable. The default is 5 seconds.

Specify the type of the key to fetch from the scanned hosts. The possible values are

or

Multiple values may be specified by separating them with commas. The default is to fetch all the above key types.

Verbose mode: print debugging messages about progress.

If an ssh_known_hosts file is constructed using

without verifying the keys, users will be vulnerable to

attacks. On the other hand, if the security model allows such a risk,

can help in the detection of tampered keyfiles or man in the middle attacks which have begun after the ssh_known_hosts file was created.

Print the RSA host key for machine

Search a network range, printing all supported key types:

Find all hosts from the file

which have new or different keys from those in the sorted file

wrote the initial version, and

added support for protocol version 2.
