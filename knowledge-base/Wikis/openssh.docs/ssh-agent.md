# Ssh Agent

is a program to hold private keys used for public key authentication. Through use of environment variables the agent can be located and automatically used for authentication when logging in to other machines using

The options are as follows:

Bind the agent to the

socket

The default is to create a socket at a random path matching

Generate C-shell commands on standard output. This is the default if

looks like it's a csh style of shell.

Foreground mode. When this option is specified,

will not fork.

Debug mode. When this option is specified,

will not fork and will write debug information to standard error.

Specifies the hash algorithm used when displaying key fingerprints. Valid options are:

and

The default is

Kill the current agent (given by the

environment variable).

Specify an option when starting

The supported options are:

and

The

option allows clients of a forwarded

to load PKCS#11 or FIDO provider libraries. By default only local clients may perform this operation. Note that signalling that an

client is remote is performed by

and use of other tools to forward access to the agent socket may circumvent this restriction.

The

option instructs

to permit signatures using FIDO keys that might be web authentication requests. By default,

refuses signature requests for FIDO keys where the key application string does not start with

and when the data to be signed does not appear to be an

user authentication request or an

signature. The default behaviour prevents forwarded access to a FIDO key from also implicitly forwarding the ability to authenticate to websites.

Alternately the

option allows specifying a pattern-list of key application strings to replace the default application allow-list, for example:

See PATTERNS in

for a description of pattern-list syntax.

Specify a pattern-list of acceptable paths for PKCS#11 provider and FIDO authenticator middleware shared libraries that may be used with the

or

options to

Libraries that do not match the pattern list will be refused. The default list is

See PATTERNS in

for a description of pattern-list syntax.

Generate Bourne shell commands on standard output. This is the default if

does not look like it's a csh style of shell.

Bind the agent socket in a randomised subdirectory of the form

instead of the default behaviour of using a randomised name matching

Set a default value for the maximum lifetime of identities added to the agent. The lifetime may be specified in seconds or in a time format specified in

A lifetime specified for an identity with

overrides this value. Without this option the default maximum lifetime is forever.

and then exit immediately. If this option is given twice,

will delete stale agent sockets regardless of the host name that created them.

If a command (and optional arguments) is given, this is executed as a subprocess of the agent. The agent exits automatically when the command given on the command line terminates.

There are three main ways to get an agent set up. The first is at the start of an X session, where all other windows or programs are started as children of the

program. The agent starts a command under which its environment variables are exported, for example

When the command terminates, so does the agent.

The second method is used for a login session. When

is started, it prints the shell commands required to set its environment variables, which in turn can be evaluated in the calling shell, for example

In both of these cases,

looks at these environment variables and uses them to establish a connection to the agent.

The third way to run

is via socket activation from a supervising process, such as systemd. In this mode, the supervising process creates the listening socket and is responsible for starting

as needed, and also for communicating the location of the socket listener to other programs in the user's session. Socket activation is used when

is started with either of the

or

flags, no socket listening address specified by the

flag, and both the

and

environment variables correctly supplied by the supervising process.

The agent initially does not have any private keys. Keys are added using

Connections to

option to

(but see the caveats documented therein), avoiding the need for authentication data to be stored on other machines. Authentication passphrases and private keys never go over the network: the connection to the agent is forwarded over SSH remote connections and the result is returned to the requester, allowing the user access to their identities anywhere in the network in a secure fashion.
