DESCRIPTION


This program is part of the   samba
	 7   suite.


smbd
 is the server daemon that
	provides filesharing and printing services to Windows clients.
	The server provides filespace and printer services to
	clients using the SMB (or CIFS) protocol. This is compatible
	with the LanManager protocol, and can service LanManager
	clients.  These include MSCLIENT 3.0 for DOS, Windows for
	Workgroups, Windows 95/98/ME, Windows NT, Windows 2000,
	OS/2, DAVE for Macintosh, and smbfs for Linux.


An extensive description of the services that the
	server can provide is given in the man page for the
	configuration file controlling the attributes of those
	services (see   smb.conf
	 5  .  This man page will not describe the
	services, but will concentrate on the administrative aspects
	of running the server.


Please note that there are significant security
	implications to running this server, and the   smb.conf
	 5   manual page should be regarded as mandatory reading before
	proceeding with installation.


A session is created whenever a client requests one.
	Each client gets a copy of the server for each session. This
	copy then services all connections made by the client during
	that session. When all connections from its client are closed,
	the copy of the server for that client terminates.


The configuration file, and any files that it includes,
	are automatically reloaded every three minutes, if they change.
	One can force a reload by sending a SIGHUP to the server. Reloading
	the configuration file will not affect connections to any service
	that is already established.  Either the user will have to
	disconnect from the service, or
smbd
 killed and restarted.


Instead of sending a SIGHUP signal, a request to reload configuration
	file may be sent using   smbcontrol
	 1   program.


OPTIONS


-D|--daemon


If specified, this parameter causes
		the server to operate as a daemon. That is, it detaches
		itself and runs in the background, fielding requests
		on the appropriate port. Operating the server as a
		daemon is the recommended way of running
smbd
 for
		servers that provide more than casual use file and
		print services.  This switch is assumed if
smbd

 is executed on the command line of a shell.


-i|--interactive


If this parameter is specified it causes the
		server to run "interactively", not as a daemon, even if the
		server is executed on the command line of a shell. Setting this
		parameter negates the implicit daemon mode when run from the
		command line.
smbd
 will only accept one
		connection and terminate. It will also log to standard output,
		as if the
-S
 parameter had been given.


-F|--foreground


If specified, this parameter causes
		the main
smbd
 process to not daemonize,
		i.e. double-fork and disassociate with the terminal.
		Child processes are still created as normal to service
		each connection request, but the main process does not
		exit. This operation mode is suitable for running

smbd
 under process supervisors such
		as
supervise
 and
svscan

		from Daniel J. Bernstein's
daemontools

		package, or the AIX process monitor.


--no-process-group


Do not create a new process group for smbd.


-b|--build-options


Prints information about how
		Samba was built.


-p|--port


port number(s)
 is a
		space or comma-separated list of TCP ports smbd should listen on.
		The default value is taken from the   parameter in


The default ports are 139 (used for SMB over NetBIOS over TCP)
			and port 445 (used for plain SMB over TCP).


-P|--profiling-level


profiling level
 is a
		number specifying the level of profiling data to be collected.
		0 turns off profiling, 1 turns on counter profiling only,
		2 turns on complete profiling, and 3 resets all profiling data.


FILES


 /etc/inetd.conf


If the server is to be run by the

inetd
 meta-daemon, this file
		must contain suitable startup information for the
		meta-daemon.


 /etc/rc


or whatever initialization script your
		system uses).


If running the server as a daemon at startup,
		this file will need to contain an appropriate startup
		sequence for the server.


 /etc/services


If running the server via the
		meta-daemon
inetd
, this file
		must contain a mapping of service name (e.g., netbios-ssn)
		to service port (e.g., 139) and protocol type (e.g., tcp).


 /usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf


This is the default location of the   smb.conf
		 5   server configuration file. Other common places that systems
		install this file are  /usr/samba/lib/smb.conf
		and  /etc/samba/smb.conf .


This file describes all the services the server
		is to make available to clients. See   smb.conf
		 5   for more information.


LIMITATIONS


On some systems
smbd
 cannot change uid back
	to root after a setuid() call.  Such systems are called
	trapdoor uid systems. If you have such a system,
	you will be unable to connect from a client (such as a PC) as
	two different users at once. Attempts to connect the
	second user will result in access denied or
	similar.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES


 PRINTER


If no printer name is specified to
		printable services, most systems will use the value of
		this variable (or  lp  if this variable is
		not defined) as the name of the printer to use. This
		is not specific to the server, however.


PAM INTERACTION


Samba uses PAM for authentication (when presented with a plaintext
	password), for account checking (is this account disabled?) and for
	session management.  The degree too which samba supports PAM is restricted
	by the limitations of the SMB protocol and the     smb.conf
	 5   parameter.  When this is set, the following restrictions apply:


 Account Validation :  All accesses to a
	samba server are checked
	against PAM to see if the account is valid, not disabled and is permitted to
	login at this time.  This also applies to encrypted logins.


 Session Management :  When not using share
	level security, users must pass PAM's session checks before access
	is granted.  Note however, that this is bypassed in share level security.
	Note also that some older pam configuration files may need a line
	added for session support.


VERSION


This man page is part of version  of
	the Samba suite.


DIAGNOSTICS


Most diagnostics issued by the server are logged
	in a specified log file. The log file name is specified
	at compile time, but may be overridden on the command line.


The number and nature of diagnostics available depends
	on the debug level used by the server. If you have problems, set
	the debug level to 3 and peruse the log files.


Most messages are reasonably self-explanatory. Unfortunately,
	at the time this man page was created, there are too many diagnostics
	available in the source code to warrant describing each and every
	diagnostic. At this stage your best bet is still to grep the
	source code and inspect the conditions that gave rise to the
	diagnostics you are seeing.


TDB FILES


Samba stores it's data in several TDB (Trivial Database) files, usually located in  /var/lib/samba .


	(*) information persistent across restarts (but not
	necessarily important to backup).

byte range locks


browse.dat


browse lists


gencache.tdb


generic caching db


group_mapping.tdb*

SIGNALS


Sending the
smbd
 a SIGHUP will cause it to
	reload its  smb.conf  configuration
	file within a short period of time.


To shut down a user's
smbd
 process it is recommended
	that
SIGKILL (-9)
  NOT
	be used, except as a last resort, as this may leave the shared
	memory area in an inconsistent state. The safe way to terminate
	an
smbd
 is to send it a SIGTERM (-15) signal and wait for
	it to die on its own.


The debug log level of
smbd
 may be raised
	or lowered using   smbcontrol
	 1   program (SIGUSR[1|2] signals are no longer
	used since Samba 2.2). This is to allow transient problems to be diagnosed,
	whilst still running at a normally low log level.


Note that as the signal handlers send a debug write,
	they are not re-entrant in
smbd
. This you should wait until

smbd
 is in a state of waiting for an incoming SMB before
	issuing them. It is possible to make the signal handlers safe
	by un-blocking the signals before the select call and re-blocking
	them after, however this would affect performance.
