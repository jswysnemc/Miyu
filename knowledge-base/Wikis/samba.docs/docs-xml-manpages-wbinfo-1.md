# DESCRIPTION

This tool is part of the `samba(7)` suite.

The `wbinfo` program queries and returns information created and used by the `winbindd(8)` daemon.

The `winbindd(8)` daemon must be configured and running for the `wbinfo` program to be able to return information.

# OPTIONS

-a\|--authenticate \<username%password\>
Attempt to authenticate a user via `winbindd(8)`. This checks both authentication methods and reports its results.

> [!NOTE]
> Do not be tempted to use this functionality for authentication in third-party applications. Instead use `ntlm_auth(1)`.

--allocate-gid
Get a new GID out of idmap

--allocate-uid
Get a new UID out of idmap

--all-domains
List all domains (trusted and own domain).

-c\|--change-secret
Change the trust account password. May be used in conjunction with `domain` in order to change interdomain trust account passwords.

--change-secret-at \<domain-controller\>
Change the trust account password at a specific domain controller. Fails if the specified domain controller cannot be contacted.

--ccache-save \<username%password\>
Store user and password for ccache.

--change-user-password \<username\>
Change the password of a user. The old and new password will be prompted.

--dc-info \<domain\>
Displays information about the current domain controller for a domain.

--domain \<name\>
This parameter sets the domain on which any specified operations will performed. If special domain name '.' is used to represent the current domain to which `winbindd(8)` belongs. A '\*' as the domain name means to enumerate over all domains (NOTE: This can take a long time and use a lot of memory).

-D\|--domain-info \<domain\>
Show most of the info we have about the specified domain.

--dsgetdcname \<domain\>
Find a DC for a domain.

--gid-info \<gid\>
Get group info from gid.

--group-info \<group\>
Get group info from group name.

-g\|--domain-groups
This option will list all groups available in the Windows NT domain for which the `samba(7)` daemon is operating in. Groups in all trusted domains can be listed with the --domain='\*' option. Note that this operation does not assign group ids to any groups that have not already been seen by `winbindd(8)`.

--get-auth-user
Print username and password used by `winbindd(8)` during session setup to a domain controller. Username and password can be set using `--set-auth-user`. Only available for root.

--getdcname \<domain\>
Get the DC name for the specified domain.

-G\|--gid-to-sid \<gid\>
Try to convert a UNIX group id to a Windows NT SID. If the gid specified does not refer to one within the idmap gid range then the operation will fail.

-?
Print brief help overview.

-i\|--user-info \<user\>
Get user info.

-I\|--WINS-by-ip \
The `-I` option queries `winbindd(8)` to send a node status request to get the NetBIOS name associated with the IP address specified by the `ip` parameter.

-K\|--krb5auth \<username%password\>
Attempt to authenticate a user via Kerberos.

--krb5ccname \<KRB5CCNAME\>
Allows one to request a specific kerberos credential cache type used for authentication.

--lanman
Use lanman cryptography for user authentication.

--logoff
Logoff a user.

--logoff-uid \<UID\>
Define user uid used during logoff request.

--logoff-user \<USERNAME\>
Define username used during logoff request.

--lookup-sids \<SID1,SID2...\>
Looks up SIDs. SIDs must be specified as ASCII strings in the traditional Microsoft format. For example, S-1-5-21-1455342024-3071081365-2475485837-500.

-m\|--trusted-domains
Produce a list of domains trusted by the Windows NT server `winbindd(8)` contacts when resolving names. This list does not include the Windows NT domain the server is a Primary Domain Controller for.

-n\|--name-to-sid \<name\>
The `-n` option queries `winbindd(8)` for the SID associated with the name specified. Domain names can be specified before the user name by using the winbind separator character. For example CWDOM1/Administrator refers to the Administrator user in the domain CWDOM1. If no domain is specified then the domain used is the one specified in the `smb.conf(5)` `workgroup` parameter.

-N\|--WINS-by-name \<name\>
The `-N` option queries `winbindd(8)` to query the WINS server for the IP address associated with the NetBIOS name specified by the `name` parameter.

--ntlmv1
Use NTLMv1 cryptography for user authentication.

--ntlmv2
Use NTLMv2 cryptography for user authentication. NTLMv2 is the default method, this option is only maintained for compatibility.

--online-status \<domain\>
Display whether winbind currently maintains an active connection or not. An optional domain argument limits the output to the online status of a given domain.

--own-domain
List own domain.

--pam-logon \<username%password\>
Attempt to authenticate a user in the same way pam_winbind would do.

-p\|--ping
Check whether `winbindd(8)` is still alive. Prints out either 'succeeded' or 'failed'.

-P\|--ping-dc
Issue a no-effect command to our DC. This checks if our secure channel connection to our domain controller is still alive. It has much less impact than wbinfo -t.

-r\|--user-groups \<username\>
Try to obtain the list of UNIX group ids to which the user belongs. This only works for users defined on a Domain Controller.

There are two scenaries:

1.  User authenticated: When the user has been authenticated, the access token for the user is cached. The correct group memberships are then returned from the cached user token (which can be outdated).

2.  User \*NOT\* authenticated: The information is queries from the domain controller using the machine account credentials which have limited permissions. The result is normally incomplete and can be also incorrect.

-R\|--lookup-rids \<rid1, rid2, rid3...\>
Converts RIDs to names. Uses a comma separated list of rids.

--remove-gid-mapping \<GID,SID\>
Removes an existing GID to SID mapping from the database.

--remove-uid-mapping \<UID,SID\>
Removes an existing UID to SID mapping from the database.

-s\|--sid-to-name \<sid\>
Use `-s` to resolve a SID to a name. This is the inverse of the `-n` option above. SIDs must be specified as ASCII strings in the traditional Microsoft format. For example, S-1-5-21-1455342024-3071081365-2475485837-500.

--separator
Get the active winbind separator.

--set-auth-user \<username%password\>
Store username and password used by `winbindd(8)` during session setup to a domain controller. This enables winbindd to operate in a Windows 2000 domain with Restrict Anonymous turned on (a.k.a. Permissions compatible with Windows 2000 servers only).

--set-gid-mapping \<GID,SID\>
Create a GID to SID mapping in the database.

--set-uid-mapping \<UID,SID\>
Create a UID to SID mapping in the database.

-S\|--sid-to-uid \<sid\>
Convert a SID to a UNIX user id. If the SID does not correspond to a UNIX user mapped by `winbindd(8)` then the operation will fail.

--sid-aliases \<sid\>
Get SID aliases for a given SID.

--sid-to-fullname \<sid\>
Converts a SID to a full username (DOMAIN\username).

--sids-to-unix-ids \<sid1,sid2,sid3...\>
Resolve SIDs to Unix IDs. SIDs must be specified as ASCII strings in the traditional Microsoft format. For example, S-1-5-21-1455342024-3071081365-2475485837-500.

-t\|--check-secret
Verify that the workstation trust account created when the Samba server is added to the Windows NT domain is working. May be used in conjunction with `domain` in order to verify interdomain trust accounts.

-u\|--domain-users
This option will list all users available in the Windows NT domain for which the `winbindd(8)` daemon is operating in. Users in all trusted domains can be listed with the --domain='\*' option. Note that this operation does not assign user ids to any users that have not already been seen by `winbindd(8)` .

--uid-info \<uid\>
Get user info for the user connected to user id UID.

--usage
Print brief help overview.

--user-domgroups \<sid\>
Get user domain groups.

--user-sidinfo \<sid\>
Get user info by sid.

--user-sids \<sid\>
Get user group SIDs for user.

-U\|--uid-to-sid \<uid\>
Try to convert a UNIX user id to a Windows NT SID. If the uid specified does not refer to one within the idmap range then the operation will fail.

--verbose
Print additional information about the query results.

-Y\|--sid-to-gid \<sid\>
Convert a SID to a UNIX group id. If the SID does not correspond to a UNIX group mapped by `winbindd(8)` then the operation will fail.

# EXIT STATUS

The wbinfo program returns 0 if the operation succeeded, or 1 if the operation failed. If the `winbindd(8)` daemon is not working `wbinfo` will always return failure.

# VERSION

# AUTHOR

The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.

`wbinfo` and `winbindd` were written by Tim Potter.

The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to DocBook XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy.
