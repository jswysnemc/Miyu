# DESCRIPTION

The Samba software suite is a collection of programs that implements the Server Message Block (commonly abbreviated as SMB) protocol for UNIX systems and provides Active Directory services. The first version of the SMB protocol is sometimes also referred to as the Common Internet File System (CIFS). For a more thorough description, see <http://www.ubiqx.org/cifs/>. Samba also implements the NetBIOS protocol in nmbd.

`samba(8)`
The `samba` daemon provides the Active Directory services and file and print services to SMB clients. The configuration file for this daemon is described in `smb.conf(5)`.

`smbd(8)`
The `smbd` daemon provides the file and print services to SMB clients. The configuration file for this daemon is described in `smb.conf(5)`.

`nmbd(8)`
The `nmbd` daemon provides NetBIOS nameservice and browsing support. The configuration file for this daemon is described in `smb.conf(5)`.

`winbindd(8)`
`winbindd` is a daemon that is used for integrating authentication and the user database into unix.

`smbclient(1)`
The `smbclient` program implements a simple ftp-like client. This is useful for accessing SMB shares on other compatible SMB servers, and can also be used to allow a UNIX box to print to a printer attached to any SMB server.

`samba-tool(8)`
The `samba-tool` is the main Samba Administration tool regarding Active Directory services.

`testparm(1)`
The `testparm` utility is a simple syntax checker for Samba's `smb.conf(5)` configuration file. In AD server mode `samba-tool testparm` should be used though.

`smbstatus(1)`
The `smbstatus` tool provides access to information about the current connections to `smbd`.

`nmblookup(1)`
The `nmblookup` tool allows NetBIOS name queries to be made.

`smbpasswd(8)`
The `smbpasswd` command is a tool for setting passwords on local Samba but also on remote SMB servers.

`smbcacls(1)`
The `smbcacls` command is a tool to set ACL's on remote SMB servers.

`smbtree(1)`
The `smbtree` command is a text-based network neighborhood tool.

`smbtar(1)`
The `smbtar` can make backups of data directly from SMB servers.

`smbspool(8)`
`smbspool` is a helper utility for printing on printers connected to SMB servers.

`smbcontrol(1)`
`smbcontrol` is a utility that can change the behaviour of running `samba`, `smbd`, `nmbd` and `winbindd` daemons.

`rpcclient(1)`
`rpcclient` is a utility that can be used to execute RPC commands on remote SMB servers.

`pdbedit(8)`
The `pdbedit` command can be used to maintain the local user database on a Samba server.

`net(8)`
The `net` command is the main administration tool for Samba member and standalone servers.

`wbinfo(1)`
`wbinfo` is a utility that retrieves and stores information related to winbind.

`profiles(1)`
`profiles` is a command-line utility that can be used to replace all occurrences of a certain SID with another SID.

`log2pcap(1)`
`log2pcap` is a utility for generating pcap trace files from Samba log files.

`vfstest(1)`
`vfstest` is a utility that can be used to test vfs modules.

`ntlm_auth(1)`
`ntlm_auth` is a helper-utility for external programs wanting to do NTLM-authentication.

`smbcquotas(1)`
`smbcquotas` is a tool to manage quotas on remote SMB servers.

# COMPONENTS

The Samba suite is made up of several components. Each component is described in a separate manual page. It is strongly recommended that you read the documentation that comes with Samba and the manual pages of those components that you use. If the manual pages and documents aren't clear enough then please visit [https://devel.samba.org](https://devel.samba.org/) for information on how to file a bug report or submit a patch.

If you require help, visit the Samba webpage at <https://www.samba.org/> and explore the many option available to you.

# AVAILABILITY

The Samba software suite is licensed under the GNU Public License(GPL). A copy of that license should have come with the package in the file COPYING. You are encouraged to distribute copies of the Samba suite, but please obey the terms of this license.

The latest version of the Samba suite can be obtained from <https://download.samba.org/pub/samba/>.

The Samba Wiki at [https://wiki.samba.org](https://wiki.samba.org/) has also a lot of useful information. On the Samba mailing list at [https://lists.samba.org](https://lists.samba.org/) you can find a lot of information in the archives and you can subscribe to the samba list and ask for help or discuss things.

# VERSION

This man page is part of version of the Samba suite.

# CONTRIBUTIONS

If you wish to contribute to the Samba project, then I suggest you join the Samba mailing list at [https://lists.samba.org](https://lists.samba.org/).

If you have patches to submit, visit <https://devel.samba.org/> for information on how to do it properly. We prefer patches in `git format-patch` format.

# CONTRIBUTORS

Contributors to the project are now too numerous to mention here but all deserve the thanks of all Samba users. To see a full list, look at the `change-log` in the source package for the pre-CVS changes and at <https://git.samba.org/> for the contributors to Samba post-GIT. GIT is the Open Source source code control system used by the Samba Team to develop Samba. The project would have been unmanageable without it.

# AUTHOR

The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
