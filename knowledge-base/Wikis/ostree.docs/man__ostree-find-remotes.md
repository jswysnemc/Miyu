## Name

ostree-find-remotes — Find remotes to serve the given refs

## Synopsis

`ostree find-remotes` \[OPTIONS...\] {COLLECTION-ID} {REF} \[COLLECTION-ID REF...\]

## Description

OSTree has the ability to pull not just from the configured remote servers but also from peer computers on the LAN and from mounted filesystems such as USB drives. This functionality requires the use of collection IDs and GPG verification.

The **find-remotes** command searches for remotes which claim to provide one or more of the given COLLECTION-ID REF pairs and prints information about them, with remotes sorted by latency (Mounts \> LAN \> Internet). By default, OSTree searches for remotes in configuration files, on mounted filesystems (in a well-known location), and on the LAN using Avahi. Searching for LAN remotes requires OSTree to have been compiled with Avahi support, and it requires an Avahi daemon to be running. You can override the default set of finders (sources for remotes) using the `--finders` option documented below.

The **create-usb** command is the recommended way to put refs on a USB such that **find-remotes** will discover them. See [ostree-create-usb(1)](man__ostree-create-usb.md).

## Options

`--cache-dir`=DIR  
Use an alternate cache directory in `DIR`.

`--disable-fsync`  
Do not invoke fsync().

`--finders`=FINDERS  
Use the specified comma separated list of finders rather than the default set. Possible values: `config`, `lan`, and `mount` (or any combination thereof).

`--pull`  
Pull the most recent commit found for each ref.

`--mirror`  
Do a mirror pull (see the documentation for **ostree pull --mirror**). This option can only be used in combination with `--pull`.

## Example

**\$ ostree find-remotes --finders=mount,lan com.exampleos.Os exampleos/x86_64/standard**
