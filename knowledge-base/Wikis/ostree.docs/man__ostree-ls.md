ostree-ls — List file paths

## Synopsis

`ostree ls` \[OPTIONS...\] {COMMIT} \[PATHS...\]

## Description

Prints a list of file paths within the given commit, and within the given path(s) if specified. The first letter of the file line output specifies the type: "-" for regular file, "d" for directory, "l" for symbolic link. See EXAMPLE section for more detail on the specific output.

## Options

`--dironly`,`-d`  
Do not recurse into directory arguments.

`--recursive`,`-R`  
Print directories recursively.

`--checksum`,`-C`  
Print checksum.

`--xattrs`,`-X`  
Print extended attributes.

`--nul-filenames-only`

## Example

**\$ ostree ls my-branch**

``` programlisting
        d00644 0 0    0 /
        -00644 0 0    2 /helloworld.txt
        d00755 0 0    0 /testdirectory
```

Here, the first column is the file-type symbol (as explained in the DESCRIPTION section) followed by the S_IFMT file type. The next two columns (here: 0 0) are respectively the user ID and group ID for the file. After the break, the next number represents that file's standard size. The final column is the file path.
