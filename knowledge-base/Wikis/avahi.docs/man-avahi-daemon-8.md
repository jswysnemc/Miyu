# Man / Avahi Daemon

avahi-daemon [ options ]
       avahi-daemon  --kill
       avahi-daemon  --reload
       avahi-daemon  --check


       The Avahi mDNS/DNS-SD daemon implements Apple's Zeroconf
      architecture (also known as "Rendezvous" or "Bonjour"). The daemon
      registers local IP addresses and static services using
      mDNS/DNS-SD and provides two IPC APIs for local programs to make
      use of the mDNS record cache the avahi-daemon maintains. First
      there is the so called "simple protocol" which is used
      exclusively by avahi-dnsconfd (a daemon which configures unicast
      DNS servers using server info published via mDNS) and nss-mdns
      (a libc NSS plugin, providing name resolution via mDNS). Finally
      there is the D-Bus interface which provides a rich object
      oriented interface to D-Bus enabled applications.

       Upon startup avahi-daemon interprets its configuration file
       @pkgsysconfdir@/avahi-daemon.conf  and reads XML
      fragments from  @servicedir@/*.service  which may
      define static DNS-SD services. If you enable
       publish-resolv-conf-dns-servers  in
       avahi-daemon.conf  the file
       /etc/resolv.conf  will be read, too.


		  -f | --file=   FILE
		  Specify the configuration file to read. (default: @pkgsysconfdir@/avahi-daemon.conf)


		  -D | --daemonize
		  Daemonize after startup. Implies  --syslog .


          -s | --syslog
          Log to syslog instead of STDERR. Implied by  --daemonize .


          --debug
          Increase verbosity to debug level.


          --no-rlimits
          Don't enforce resource limits as specified in the configuration file. (See   for more information)


          --no-drop-root
          Don't drop root privileges after startup and don't require daemon to be started as root. We recommend not to use this option.


          --no-chroot
          Don't   the daemon. This option is only available when compiled with chroot() support.


          --no-proc-title
          Don't change the process name while
        running. Unless this option is specified avahi-daemon will reflect
        its current state and the selected host name in the process
        title.


		  -k | --kill
		  Kill an already running avahi-daemon. (equivalent to sending a SIGTERM)


		  -r | --reload
		  Tell an already running avahi-daemon to reread
		 /etc/resolv.conf  (in case you enabled
         publish-resolv-conf-dns-servers  in
		 avahi-daemon.conf ) and the files from
		 @servicedir@/ . Please note that this will not
		reload the
		 @pkgsysconfdir@/avahi-daemon.conf . (equivalent to
		sending a SIGHUP)


		  -c | --check
		  Return 0 as return code when avahi-daemon is already running.


		  -h | --help
		  Show help


		  -v | --version
		  Show version information


        @pkgsysconfdir@/avahi-daemon.conf : the default configuration file for avahi-daemon, see   for more information.

        @pkgsysconfdir@/hosts : additional static hostname mappings to publish in mDNS, see   for more information.

        @servicedir@/*.service : static service definitions, see   for more information.


        SIGINT, SIGTERM : avahi-daemon will shutdown. (Same as  --kill ).
        SIGHUP : avahi-daemon will reload unicast DNS
      server data from  /etc/resolv.conf  and static
      service definitions from  @servicedir@/ . (Same as  --reload )
        SIGUSR1 : avahi-daemon will dump local and remote cached resource record data to syslog.
