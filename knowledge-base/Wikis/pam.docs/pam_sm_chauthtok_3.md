# pam_sm_chauthtok(3)

## Name
pam_sm_chauthtok — PAM service function for authentication token management

## DESCRIPTION

The `pam_sm_chauthtok` function is the service module's implementation of the `pam_chauthtok(3)` interface.

This function is used to (re-)set the authentication token of the user.

Valid flags, which may be logically OR'd with *PAM_SILENT*, are:

PAM_SILENT  
Do not emit any messages.

PAM_CHANGE_EXPIRED_AUTHTOK  
This argument indicates to the module that the user's authentication token (password) should only be changed if it has expired. This flag is optional and *must* be combined with one of the following two flags. Note, however, the following two options are *mutually exclusive*.

PAM_PRELIM_CHECK  
This indicates that the modules are being probed as to their ready status for altering the user's authentication token. If the module requires access to another system over some network it should attempt to verify it can connect to this system on receiving this flag. If a module cannot establish it is ready to update the user's authentication token it should return *PAM_TRY_AGAIN*, this information will be passed back to the application.

If the control value *sufficient* is used in the password stack, the *PAM_PRELIM_CHECK* section of the modules following that control value is not always executed.

PAM_UPDATE_AUTHTOK  
This informs the module that this is the call it should change the authorization tokens. If the flag is logically OR'd with *PAM_CHANGE_EXPIRED_AUTHTOK*, the token is only changed if it has actually expired.

The PAM library calls this function twice in succession. The first time with *PAM_PRELIM_CHECK* and then, if the module does not return *PAM_TRY_AGAIN*, subsequently with *PAM_UPDATE_AUTHTOK*. It is only on the second call that the authorization token is (possibly) changed.

## RETURN VALUES

PAM_AUTHTOK_ERR  
The module was unable to obtain the new authentication token.

PAM_AUTHTOK_RECOVERY_ERR  
The module was unable to obtain the old authentication token.

PAM_AUTHTOK_LOCK_BUSY  
Cannot change the authentication token since it is currently locked.

PAM_AUTHTOK_DISABLE_AGING  
Authentication token aging has been disabled.

PAM_PERM_DENIED  
Permission denied.

PAM_TRY_AGAIN  
Preliminary check was unsuccessful. Signals an immediate return to the application is desired.

PAM_SUCCESS  
The authentication token was successfully updated.

PAM_USER_UNKNOWN  
User unknown to password service.
