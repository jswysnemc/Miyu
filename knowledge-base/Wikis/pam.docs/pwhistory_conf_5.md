# pwhistory.conf(5)

## Name
pwhistory.conf — pam_pwhistory configuration file

## DESCRIPTION

*pwhistory.conf* provides a way to configure the default settings for saving the last passwords for each user. This file is read by the *pam_pwhistory* module and is the preferred method over configuring *pam_pwhistory* directly.

The file has a very simple *name = value* format with possible comments starting with *\#* character. The whitespace at the beginning of line, end of line, and around the *=* sign is ignored.

## OPTIONS

debug  
Turns on debugging via `syslog(3)`.

enforce_for_root  
If this option is set, the check is enforced for root, too.

remember=N  
The last \<N\> passwords for each user are saved. The default is *10*. Value of *0* makes the module to keep the existing contents of the `opasswd` file unchanged.

retry=N  
Prompt user at most \<N\> times before returning with error. The default is 1.

file=/path/filename  
Store password history in file \</path/filename\> rather than the default location. The default location is `/etc/security/opasswd`.

## EXAMPLES

/etc/security/pwhistory.conf file example:

    debug
    remember=5
    file=/tmp/opasswd
