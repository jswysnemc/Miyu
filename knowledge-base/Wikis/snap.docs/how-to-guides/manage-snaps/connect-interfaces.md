# Connect interfaces

Interfaces permit or deny access to a resource outside of a snap's confinement.

Most users don't need to worry about interfaces. Snaps are designed for strong application isolation and safe interface connections are made automatically.

An interface is most commonly used to enable a snap to access sound playback or recording, your network, and your $HOME directory. But which interfaces a snap requires, and *provides*, is very much dependent on the type of snap and its own requirements.

See [Interfaces](https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/interfaces/) for a comprehensive list of interfaces and what kind of access they permit.

## Plugs and slots

An interface provides a level of access to resources, such as audio playback, as defined by a *slot*. One or more snaps can access this resource by connecting a corresponding *plug* to the slot.

In other words, the slot is the provider of the resource while the plug is the consumer, and a slot can support multiple plug connections.

![How an interfaces uses a plug and a slot](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/59c290a8-snapd-interfaces.png)

In the output to `snap connections vlc` (see above), every interface used by VLC is listed in the first column. The *Plug* and *Slot* columns then describe how each interface is connected.

For instance, the `audio-playback` interface connects VLC's audio-playback plug to the system's audio-playback slot so you can hear the sound it produces.

## Listing interfaces

You can see which snaps are using an interface with the `interface` command:

```
$ snap interface audio-playback
name:    audio-playback
summary: allows audio playback via supporting services
plugs:
  - chromium
  - vlc
  - zoom-client
slots:
  - snapd
```

In the above output, you can see that Chromium, VLC and the Zoom snaps are connected to _snapd's_ audio-playback slot, which is synonymous with *Core* and *system*.

To see all the interfaces being used by your system, run `snap interface`. To see all the interfaces available to your system, including those not currently being used, run `snap interface --all`.

## Snap connections

On the terminal, the _snap_ command provides more granular control over interface connections and which interfaces are operational on your system.

The `snap connections` command lists which interfaces are connected and being used, while adding `--all` additionally shows interfaces with unconnected slots or plugs (shown in the output as a `-`):

```
$ snap connections --all
Interface            Plug                           Slot                     Notes
adb-support          scrcpy:adb-support             :adb-support             -
alsa                 ffmpeg:alsa                    :alsa                    manual
appstream-metadata   snap-store:appstream-metadata  :appstream-metadata      -
iaudio-playback      ardour:audio-playback          :audio-playback          -
dbus                 -                              cameractrls:dbus-daemon  -
[...]
```

To see which interfaces a snap is using, and which interfaces it could use but isn't, type `snap connections <snapname>`:

```
$ snap connections vlc
Interface       Plug                   Slot                 Notes
audio-playback  vlc:audio-playback     :audio-playback      -
audio-record    vlc:audio-record       -                    -
camera          vlc:camera             -                    -
desktop         vlc:desktop            :desktop             -
home            vlc:home               :home                -
(...)
```

In the above output, the [`camera`](https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/interfaces/camera-interface/) interface is not connected because its slot is empty. This means VLC cannot access any connected cameras.

VLC can access the user's _/home_ directory because the [`home`](https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/interfaces/home-interface/) interface is connected to the system `$HOME` directory (denoted by the `:home` slot name).

To see all connected interfaces on your system, use the _snap connections_ command without a snap name:

```
$ snap connections
Interface      Plug                    Slot                 Notes
adb-support    scrcpy:adb-support      :adb-support         -
alsa           ffmpeg:alsa             :alsa                manual
alsa           telegram-desktop:alsa   :alsa                manual
audio-playback ardour:audio-playback   :audio-playback      -
audio-playback chromium:audio-playback :audio-playback      -
(...)
```

Adding `--all` to the _snap connections_ command will list all interfaces, including those without a connection:

```
$ snap connections --all
Interface      Plug                    Slot                 Notes
adb-support    scrcpy:adb-support      :adb-support         -
alsa           entropypianotuner:alsa  -                    -
alsa           ffmpeg:alsa             :alsa                manual
alsa           guvcview:alsa           -                    -
(...)
```

### Auto-connections

Many interfaces are automatically connected when a snap is installed, and this ability is a property of either the interface itself, or the snap.

Automatically connecting interfaces include the [network](https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/interfaces/network-interface/), [audio-playback](https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/interfaces/audio-playback-interface/) and [opengl](https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/interfaces/opengl-interface/) interfaces. This _auto-connection_ ability is carefully reviewed for each interface, where permissiveness, security and privacy implications, and the expectations of the user, are all considered.

A snap's developer can also request that an interface is connected automatically through a [manual review process](https://snapcraft.io/docs/how-to-guides/manage-snaps/apps-and-aliases/). As above, these requests are carefully considered and reviewed before being granted or denied.

Interfaces not connected automatically require the user to make a manual connection (see below), such as the [camera](https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/interfaces/camera-interface/), [removable-media](https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/interfaces/removable-media-interface/) and [audio-record](https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/interfaces/audio-record-interface/) interfaces. Manual connections enable the user to have a complete control over what kind of access they allow.

If a snap is installed prior to an interface being granted auto-connect permission, and permission is subsequently granted and the snap updated, when the installed snap updates, the interface will be auto-connected.

For more technical details on how interface auto-connections are processed, see [The interface auto-connection mechanism](https://snapcraft.io/docs/explanation/interfaces/interface-auto-connection/).

See the _Auto-connect_ column in the [Supported interfaces](https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/interfaces/) table for which interfaces are connected automatically.

### Manual connections

When you need to connect an interface manually, such as when you want to grant a snap access to [audio-record](https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/interfaces/audio-record-interface/) for audio input, use the `snap connect` command:

```
snap connect <snap>:<plug interface>
```

With no further arguments, the plug will connect to the system via the snap daemon, _snapd_.

For example, to connect VLC's _audio-record_ plug to the system's _audio-record_, you'd enter the following:

```
sudo snap connect vlc:audio-record
```

To connect an interface to a slot provided by another snap, provide this as an additional argument:

```
snap connect <snap>:<plug interface> <snap>:<slot interface>
```

A slot and a plug can only be connected if they have the same interface name.

Add the `--no-wait` option to _snap connect_ or _snap disconnect_ to run the process in the background and return immediately to the command prompt.

A successful connection grants any necessary permissions that may be required by the interface to function.

## Disconnect interfaces

To disconnect an interface, use `snap disconnect`:

```
snap disconnect <snap>:<plug interface>
```

Following our previous example, you would disconnect *vlc:audio-record* with the following command:

```
sudo snap disconnect vlc:audio-record
```

### Forget manual disconnections

When an _automatic connection_ is manually disconnected, its disconnected state is retained after a `snap refresh`. This state is even stored **after a snap has been removed**, including removal with the `--purge` option.

The `--forget` flag can be added to the disconnect command to reset this behaviour, and consequently, re-enable the automatic re-connection after a snap refresh.
