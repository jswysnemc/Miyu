        Get all the assertions in the system assertion database of the given type.
        Assertions can be filtered by providing assertion header keys as query
        parameters (e.g., `?username=canonical`). The response is a stream of
        assertions separated by double newlines. An assertion type of
        snap-declaration can also be used to retrieve a remote snap-declaration
        assertion for a given snap-id. This can also be accomplished from within the
        snap environment.

        **Unix Socket Peer Authentication**

        Authentication is not handled via traditional HTTP headers or tokens. Instead, it is managed at the operating system level using Unix domain socket peer credentials (e.g., `SO_PEERCRED` on Linux).

        **How It Works:**

        1.  The API server listens on a local Unix domain socket.
        2.  When a client connects to this socket, the server can ask the operating system kernel for the client process's credentials.
        3.  The kernel securely provides the client's User ID (UID), Group ID (GID), and Process ID (PID).

        Authorization decisions are then based on this trusted, kernel-provided UID. For example, access may be restricted to only the `root` user (UID 0).

      description: |
        A custom schedule format for defining recurring events, combining weekdays, times, spans, and frequencies.

        **Syntax Summary:**
        - A timer string is composed of one or more event sets, separated by ',,'.
        - Each event set can define weekdays ('mon', 'tue', 'wed2', 'fri5') and time windows ('10:00', '09:00-11:00').
        - Weekday spans ('mon-fri') define an event for each day in the span.
        - Time spans ('14:00-16:00') define a single event within the span, which can be divided using a count ('/2').
