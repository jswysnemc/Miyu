# Experimental features

Experimental features are part of the _snapd_ development process. They allow engineering teams to test both the viability of an idea and its implementation.

If an experimental feature is considered unstable or likely to change, they are demarcated by an experimental feature flag, such as the following for [Quota groups](https://snapcraft.io/docs/how-to-guides/manage-snaps/use-resource-quotas/).

```
sudo snap set system experimental.quota-groups=true
```
## Request for feedback

We'd be grateful for any feedback users of these experimental features may have. Please leave a comment beneath this forum post, chat to us on [Matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#snapd:ubuntu.com), or file an issue in the [snapd GitHub repository](https://github.com/canonical/snapd). Thank you!
