# System options

Snap supports a set of system-wide options that allow you to customise your snap or Ubuntu Core environment. These are listed below.

See [Setting system options](https://snapcraft.io/docs/how-to-guides/manage-snaps/set-system-options/) for further details on how they they are viewed and configured.

## pi-config

On a Raspberry Pi, the following options set corresponding values in the _config.txt_ system configuration file:

  * pi-config.disable-overscan
  * pi-config.force-turbo
  * pi-config.framebuffer-width
  * pi-config.framebuffer-height
  * pi-config.framebuffer-depth
  * pi-config.framebuffer-ignore_alpha
  * pi-config.overscan-left
  * pi-config.overscan-right
  * pi-config.overscan-top
  * pi-config.overscan-bottom
  * pi-config.overscan-scale
  * pi-config.display-rotate
  * pi-config.hdmi-cvt
  * pi-config.hdmi-group
  * pi-config.hdmi-mode
  * pi-config.hdmi-timings
  * pi-config.hdmi-drive
  * pi-config.avoid-warnings
  * pi-config.gpu-mem-256
  * pi-config.gpu-mem-512
  * pi-config.gpu-mem
  * pi-config.sdtv-aspect
 * pi-config.sdtv-mode
  * pi-config.config-hdmi-boost
  * pi-config.hdmi-force-hotplug
  * pi-config.start-x

Further details on the above, see the [official Raspberry Pi documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/config_txt.html).

> ⓘ Available only on Ubuntu Core.

## system journal.persistent

Enables or disables journal persistence. Can be `true` or `false`. If persistent journals were previously enabled by this setting, changing the value to `false` will **delete all saved logs**.

Example to enable the journal:
```
snap set system journal.persistent=true
```

> ⓘ Available only on Ubuntu Core.

## system proxy.{http,https,ftp}

These options may be set to change the proxies to be used by the system when communicating with external sites that speak the respective protocols:

```
snap set system proxy.http="http://<proxy_addr>:<proxy_port>"
snap set system proxy.https="http://<proxy_addr>:<proxy_port>"
```

> ⓘ Available only on Ubuntu Core.

## system pki.certs.custom

Enables custom certificate management with the following options (replace `<name>` with the certificate name):

- **pki.certs.custom.\<name>.content**: sets the certificate payload. This option must be set first to register the certificate in the database, and the `<name>` used in the option becomes the initially registered certificate name
- **pki.certs.custom.\<name>.name**: changes the registered certificate name after the certificate content has been set
- **pki.certs.custom.\<name>.state**: sets the certificate state to `blocked` or `accepted`. If not explicitly set, the default state is `accepted`. Setting the state to `unset` removes the certificate

The following example sets the certificate content, changes the certificate name, and blocks the certificate:

```
snap set system pki.certs.custom.<name>.content=<payload>
snap set system pki.certs.custom.<name>.name=new-name
snap set system pki.certs.custom.<name>.state=blocked
```

To remove the certificate, set its state to `unset` or unset it:

```
snap set system pki.certs.custom.<name>.state=unset
snap unset system pki.certs.custom.<name>
```

Use `snap get` to retrieve the list of custom certificates:

```
snap get system pki.certs.custom
```

> ⓘ Available only on Ubuntu Core.

> ⓘ Available since snapd _2.75_.

## system refresh

There are four system-wide options that are used to manage how updates are handed:

- **refresh.timer**: defines the refresh frequency and schedule
- **refresh.hold**: delays the next refresh until the defined time and date
- **refresh.metered**: pauses refresh updates when network connection is metered
- **refresh.retain**: sets how many revisions of a snap are stored on the system

The following example asks the system to only refresh snaps between 4.00am and 7.00am, and 7.00pm and 10:10pm:

```
snap set system refresh.timer=4:00-7:00,19:00-22:10
```

See [Controlling updates](https://snapcraft.io/docs/how-to-guides/manage-snaps/manage-updates/) for further details on how the above options are used.

## system homedirs

Allows a snap’s user data to be stored in a user’s home location other under `/home`.

```
snap set system homedirs=<destination-directory>
```

See [Home directories outside of ‘/home’](https://snapcraft.io/docs/explanation/how-snaps-work/home-outside-home/) for further details.

> ⓘ Available since snapd _2.59_.

## system interface

Permits specific interfaces options to be changed . The only option currently supported is interface [auto-connection](https://snapcraft.io/docs/explanation/interfaces/interface-auto-connection/).

- **interface.allow-auto-connection**: configure auto-connection rules for the interface, options are `{false|true|verified}`.
  * `false` or `true` controls whether auto-connections are permitted.
  * `verified` means that only snaps carrying a snap declaration can auto-connect this interface.

The following example would configure the `x11` interface
to deny all auto-connections:

```
snap set system interface.x11.allow-auto-connection=false
```

> ⓘ Available since snapd _2.73_.

## system resilience.vitality-hint

This option adjusts the Linux kernel's out-of-memory ([OOM](https://www.kernel.org/doc/gorman/html/understand/understand016.html)) killer behaviour for specific snap services.

By default, all snap services have the same value for systemd's `OOMScoreAdjust`. By passing a list of snaps ordered by decreasing importance to the `resilience.vitality-hint` system option, the order is respected if snap processes are killed in low memory situations.

The list of snaps need to be as string containing comma separated snap instance names in decreasing order of importance, such as:

```
snap set system resilience.vitality-hint=snapA,snapB,snapC
```

In the above example, services inside `snapA` are the **least likely** to be killed in _out of memory_ situations, followed by services in `snapB`, services in `snapC`, and then the services in all the other snaps not referenced by the `vitality-hint` option.

> Note:
> ⓘ  Snaps added to `resilience.vitality-hint` are still _more likely_ to be killed than the snap daemon, snapd, itself.

## system service.console-conf.disable

May be set to _true_ on devices running Ubuntu Core to disable the console-conf system configuration wizard that is launched by default when booting an initialised Ubuntu Core image.

```
snap set system service.console-conf.disable=true
```

This option is defined in the [gadget snap](https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/development/yaml-schemas/the-gadget-snap/) and cannot be changed at runtime.

> ⓘ Available only on Ubuntu Core.

## system service.ssh.disable

Can be set to _true_ to disable the SSH service at startup.

```
snap set system service.ssh.disable=true
```

> ⓘ Available only on Ubuntu Core.

## system service.ssh.listen-address

Specifies the local address that the SSH daemon should listen on.

Can be a comma separated list of hostnames, IPs or ports. When set, the SSH [ListenAddress](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/sshd_config.5.html) configuration is configured accordingly.

Port configuration needs to be in the following format: `:<port-number>`

```
snap set system service.ssh.listen-address=:8022
snap set system service.ssh.listen-address=myhost
snap set system service.ssh.listen-address=192.168.1.2,myhost,foo:8022
```

> ⓘ Available since snapd _2.59_ and only on Ubuntu Core 20 or later.

## system snapshots.automatic.retention

[Automatic snapshot](https://snapcraft.io/docs/how-to-guides/manage-snaps/create-data-snapshots/) retention time is configured with the `snapshots.automatic.retention` system option. The default value is 31 days, and the value needs to be greater than 24 hours:

```
snap set system snapshots.automatic.retention=30h
```
To disable automatic snapshots, set the retention time to `no`:

```
snap set system snapshots.automatic.retention=no
```

> ⓘ Disabling automatic snapshots will *not* affect preexisting, automatically generated snapshots, but only those generated by subsequent snap removals.

> ⓘ Automatic snapshots require snap version _2.39+_.

## system store.access

When set to `offline`, prevents the system for initiating connections to the Store.

```
snap set system store.access=offline
```

Prevention includes explicit actions, such as installing a snap, and automatic actions, such as periodic refreshes.

Unsetting the parameter restores the default access to the store.

```
snap unset system store.access
```

> ⓘ Available since snapd _2.61_ and only on Ubuntu Core.

## system store-certs

A custom SSL certificate can be added to snapd's trusted certificates pool for the store communication with the `store-certs.<name>=<value>` system option.

To add a certificate, enter the following:

```
snap set system store-certs.cert1="$(cat /path/to/mycert)"
```

A certificate can be removed with _unset_:

```
snap unset system store-certs.cert1
```

## system swap.size

Sets the swap size for the base system.

Value can be any integer multiple of a megabyte that is either larger than or equal to 1 MB, or 0 for no swap enabled:

```
snap set system swap.size=200M
```

This option is typically defined in the [gadget.yaml](https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/development/yaml-schemas/the-gadget-snap/) file when building an Ubuntu Core image:

```yaml
defaults:
  system:
    swap:
      size: 200M
```

> ⓘ Available only on Ubuntu Core.

## system system.disable-backlight-service

May be set to _true_ to disable the backlight service:

```
snap set core system.disable-backlight-service=true
```

> ⓘ Available only on Ubuntu Core.

## system system.kernel.cmdline-append

Dynamically add permitted kernel boot parameters to the default kernel command line on devices using the GRUB bootloader and with [Ubuntu Core 20/22](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/uc20/inside) or later.

```
snap set system system.kernel.cmdline-append=”opt1=val1 opt2=val2”
```
Proposed kernel boot parameters are verified against an _allow list_ in the [gadget snap](https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/development/yaml-schemas/the-gadget-snap/). See [gadget.yaml](https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/development/yaml-schemas/the-gadget-snap/) for further details on the list syntax.

This options requires the system or device to be manually restarted. The system will not restart automatically.

Consider using `system.kernel.dangerous-cmdline-append` instead if:

 - the gadget snap on your device is either the pc-gadget or pi-gadget, as the allow list isn’t defined.
 - you need to add kernel boot parameters without any verification filter.

## system system.kernel.dangerous-cmdline-append

Dynamically add any kernel boot parameters to the default kernel command line on devices using the GRUB bootloader with [Ubuntu Core 20](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/uc20/inside) or later.

```
snap set system system.kernel.dangerous-cmdline-append=”opt1=val1 opt2=val2”
```

This system setting is considered **dangerous** because any boot parameter is permitted, potentially making devices vulnerable. To add only permitted or filtered options, see `system.kernel.cmdline-append` above.

This options requires the system or device to be manually restarted. The system will not restart automatically.

## system system.kernel.printk.console-loglevel

Override the console log level with a number between 0 and 7.

The configuration will be stored in `/etc/sysctl.d/99-snapd.conf` and the default value is **4**

Example to set the log level to 1:

```
$ snap set system system.kernel.printk.console-loglevel=1
$ cat /etc/sysctl.d/99-snapd.conf
kernel.printk = 1 4 1 7
```

> ⓘ Available only on Ubuntu Core.

## system system.motd

Ubuntu Core systems come with a default message of the day. From Ubuntu Core 24 onwards, the message of the day can be customized from the defaults configuration section in the [gadget.yaml](https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/development/yaml-schemas/the-gadget-snap/) file to set a custom message available since first boot:

```yaml
defaults:
  system:
    system:
      motd: |
        Welcome to Ubuntu Core
        Wish you a great day
```

Message of the day can also be configured in a running system:

```
snap set system system.motd="$(printf "Welcome to Ubuntu Core\nWish you a great day")"
```

Here `printf` is used to handle the backslash-escaped characters such as newline.

To set a custom message from a file:

```
snap set system system.motd="$(cat /path/to/custom/motd)"
```

The custom message can be removed with _unset_ which will reset to the default message of the day:

```
snap unset system system.motd
```

> ⓘ Available only on Ubuntu Core.

## system system.network.netplan

On systems that support [Netplan](https://netplan.io/), such as Ubuntu Core 20 and 22, snapd can both query and configure the Netplan key and value notation through its _get_ and _set_ system options commands:

```
$ snap get -d system system.network.netplan
{
        "system.network.netplan": {
                "network": {
                        "ethernets": {
                                "enp0s2": {
                                        "dhcp4": true
                                }
                        },
                        "version": 2
                }
        }
}
```
Netplan key names and properties reflect a device's specification, capabilities and configuration. The `network.ethernets.enp0s2` device listed above, for example, could be `eth0` or another network device name. Equally, a device with wireless capabilities would present key value configuration options beneath `system.network.netplan.network.wifi`.

For example, the following output is typical of a static network configuration:

```yaml
{
        "system.network.netplan": {
                "network": {
                        "ethernets": {
                                "enp0s2": {
                                        "addresses": [
                                                "10.0.2.15/24"
                                        ],
                                        "gateway4": "10.0.2.2",
                                        "nameservers": {
                                                "addresses": [
                                                        "8.8.8.8",
                                                        "8.8.4.4"
                                                ],
                                                "search": []
                                        }
                                }
                        },
                        "version": 2
                }
        }
}
```

The following `snap set` command could be used to change the `gateway4` address in the above configuration:

```
snap set system system.network.netplan.network.ethernets.enp0s2.gateway4=10.0.2.1
```

See [Netplan reference](https://netplan.io/reference) for details on the key and value pairs used for network configuration.

> ⓘ Available since snapd _2.55.4_ and only on Ubuntu Core.

## system system.power-key-action

Defines the behaviour of the system when the power key is pressed.

May be set to one of:

* ignore
* poweroff
* reboot
* halt
* kexec
* suspend
* hibernate
* hybrid-sleep
* lock

To set the system power button behaviour to _hibernate_, for example, enter the following:

```
snap set system system.power-key-action=hibernate
```

> ⓘ Available only on Ubuntu Core.

## system system.timezone

May be used to set a time zone value, as typically found in `/usr/share/zoneinfo`, such as `America/Chicago`.

```
snap set system system.timezone="America/Chicago"
```

To see the current timezone settings, use the `snap get -d system`:

```
$ snap get -d system
{
        "experimental": {
                "hotplug": true,
                "layouts": true
        },
        "refresh": {
                "last": "2017-05-25T09:03:58.664837614+01:00",
                "retain": 2
        },
        "seed": {
                "loaded": true
        },
        "system": {
                "timezone": "America/Chicago"
        }
}
```

> ⓘ Available only on Ubuntu Core.

## system tmp.size

Configures the default size for the `/tmp` mount point on Ubuntu Core devices:

```
snap set system tmp.size=<size>
```

Size can given as either bytes, megabytes or gigabytes: `<bytes>`, `<bytes/2^20>M`, or `<bytes/2^30>G`.

To set the `/tmp` mount point to a size of 2GB, for example, run the following command:

```
snap set system tmp.size=2G
```

Use `snap get` to retrieve the current size:

```
snap get system tmp.size
```

To set to `/tmp` to the default size, remove any custom setting:

```
snap unset system tmp.size
```
By default, `/tmp` is set to use 50% of physical RAM.

> ⓘ Available only on Ubuntu Core.

## system users.create.automatic

When _true_, permits the system to create users automatically from a valid [system-user assertion](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/reference/assertions/system-user), such as an assertion stored on external storage (see [System user](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/system-user) for more details). When _false_, users can only created manually with _create user_ API calls:

```
snap set system users.create.automatic=false
```

Default is **true**.

## system users.lockout

When set to `True`, Ubuntu Core user accounts will be locked for 900 seconds after 3 wrong passwords.

Can be either `True` or `False`.

> ⓘ Available only on Ubuntu Core.

## system watchdog.runtime-timeout

Configures the system's hardware watchdog _runtime_ timeout.

The watchdog runtime timeout is an interval during which the system manager must contact the hardware watchdog to prevent a device from being automatically rebooted. Usage of this feature requires corresponding hardware support as the watchdog hardware, `/dev/watchdog` or the kernel option `systemd.watchdog-device=`, will be programmed to automatically reboot the system when not contacted within the specified timeout interval.

A valid value is a non-negative time duration in seconds, or suffixed with `ms`, `min`, `h`, `d`, `w` for milliseconds, minutes, hours, days and weeks respectively.

The following example will set the timeout to 1 minute:

```
snap set system watchdog.runtime-timeout=1m
```

> Important:
>
> The Raspberry Pi hardware watchdog timer is limited to a maximum timeout of 15 seconds.

> ⓘ Available only on Ubuntu Core.

## system watchdog.shutdown-timeout

Configures the system's hardware watchdog _shutdown_ timeout.

The watchdog shutdown timeout is an interval to permit a clean reboot of the system. If the system fails to reboot within this interval, the watchdog will forcibly restart the system to protect against failed or hanging reboots. Usage of this feature requires hardware support.

Note that the shutdown-timeout applies only to the second phase of a reboot, after all regular services are terminated and the system and service manager process has been replaced by the systemd-shutdown binary.

As with the _watchdog runtime timeout_, a valid value is a non-negative time duration in seconds, or suffixed with `ms`, `m`, `h`, `d`, `w` for milliseconds, minutes, hours, days and weeks respectively.

The following example will set the timeout to 500 seconds:

```
snap set system watchdog.shutdown-timeout=500
```
