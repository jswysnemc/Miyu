#  gpio-chardev interface

The `gpio-chardev` interface allows access to specific GPIO chardev lines.

Use  `snap interface gpio-chardev` to see which gpio chardev devices are available on the system:

```
$ snap interface gpio-chardev
name:          gpio-chardev
summary:       allows access to specific GPIO chardev lines
documentation: https://snapcraft.io/docs/gpio-chardev-interface
slots:
  - pi:bcm-gpio-0
  - pi:bcm-gpio-1
  - pi:bcm-gpio-10
[...]
```

## Developer details

**Auto-connect**: no

**Attributes**:
 * `source-chip` (slot, mandatory): list of alternative labels of the source GPIO chip
 * `lines` (slot, mandatory): GPIO lines present in the source chip

Requires snapd 2.72+.

Hardware IO interfaces covers some general considerations common to these kinds of devices.

When the interface is connected:
- `snap-gpio-helper` sets up a virtual GPIO device exposing the specified lines defined in the slot as a character device node at `/dev/snap/gpio-chardev/<slot-snap>/<slot-name>`.
- snapd sets up a symlink at `/dev/snap/gpio-chardev/<plug-snap>/<plug-name>` pointing at the virtual slot device mentioned above.

Once connected, the consuming snap can use the device via `/dev/snap/gpio-chardev/<plug-snap>/<plug-name>`.

Important considerations:
- Slot definitions are only allowed for gadget snaps.
- This interface cannot be used if there is an active connection to the older [`gpio`](https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/interfaces/gpio-interface/) interface.
- `source-chip` being a list enables sharing of a gadget snap between a number of devices, for which the same lines are exposed by differently labeled GPIO controllers.
- `lines` can be expressed by joining them with a comma: *n[,m]* or as a range: *n-m* (inclusive) or a combination of both, assuming the ranges do not overlap, e.g.: `lines: 0,2,4-8`.
- `lines` are exported in the order of presence in the source GPIO chip device, and not in the order in which they are declared in the attribute.
- Any given line can only be exported by one slot.
- `gpio-aggregator` kernel module with configfs support is required (i.e. UC24+).
- `gpio` interface will not work on UC26+ due to missing kernel support.

### Migration from gpio to gpio-chardev

Since `gpio` and `gpio-chardev` interfaces cannot be connected at the same time, all existing `gpio` interface connections must be disconnected first before connecting to `gpio-chardev`.

This is only required if the gadget snap has both `gpio` and `gpio-chardev` slots declared since performing a gadget refresh to a revision that only declares `gpio-chardev` slots will automatically disconnect `gpio` connections due to missing slot.

It is recommended to only have only one slot type on the gadget, either `gpio` or `gpio-chardev`.
