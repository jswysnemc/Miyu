#  gpio interface

`gpio` allows access to a specific GPIO pin. The interface is restricted because it provides privileged access to GPIO hardware.

Use  `snap interface gpio` to see which gpio devices are available on the system:

```
$ snap interface gpio
name:    gpio
summary: allows access to a specific GPIO pin
slots:
  - pi:bcm-gpio-0
  - pi:bcm-gpio-1
  - pi:bcm-gpio-10
[...]
```

## Example

The [pi-fancontrol](https://snapcraft.io/pi-fancontrol) snap provides simple fan control on a Raspberry Pi with a fan connected to GPIO 14 (pin 8). With the snap installed, the following command will connect the interface to the pin:

```
snap connect pi-fancontrol:gpio pi:bcm-gpio-14
```

## Developer details

**Auto-connect**: no

**Attributes**:
 * `number` (slot): GPIO pin number to export and expose to consuming snaps

Hardware IO interfaces covers some general considerations common to these kinds of devices.

To use a gpio device, the snap developer must add `plugs: [ gpio ]` to a snap's [snapcraft.yaml](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/snapcraft/stable/reference/project-file/anatomy-of-snapcraft-yaml/). The snap user can then access a specific gpio device with an [interface connection](https://snapcraft.io/docs/explanation/interfaces/all-about-interfaces/).

Unless the snap is expected to actually use a set of gpio pins that is not predefined,  it is recommended to define distinct plugs for each used gpio pin, like:

```yaml
plugs:
  activity-led:
    interface: gpio
  warning-led:
    interface: gpio
```

This has the advantage of being self-documenting and 1-1  connections like these are easier to track and setup with [auto-connections](https://snapcraft.io/docs/explanation/interfaces/interface-auto-connection/), if the latter is needed.

When the interface is connected, `"echo (pin number) > /sys/class/gpio/export"`  is run internally to enable access to the GPIO pin.

Once connected, the consuming snap can use the device via `/sys/class/gpio/gpioN` where `N` is the pin number specified by the connected slot.

Finally, when the interface is disconnected,  `"echo (pin number) > /sys/class/gpio/unexport"`  is run internally to disable access to the GPIO pin.

### Code examples

The hook and control scripts for _pi-fancontrol_ can be found in the project's GitHub repository: [https://github.com/ogra1/pi-fancontrol-snap](https://github.com/ogra1/pi-fancontrol-snap)

The source code for the GPIO interface is in the _snapd_ repository: [https://github.com/canonical/snapd/blob/master/interfaces/builtin/gpio.go](https://github.com/canonical/snapd/blob/master/interfaces/builtin/gpio.go).
