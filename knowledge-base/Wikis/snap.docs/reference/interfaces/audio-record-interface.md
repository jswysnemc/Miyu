#  audio-record interface

The `audio-record` interface allows an application to access your audio recording hardware, such as a microphone, via your system's audio service, such as PulseAudio. It's disabled by default.

This interface is a companion interface to the [audio-playback](https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/interfaces/audio-playback-interface/) interface, and is not intended to be used without it.

## Example

The brilliant [OBS Studio](https://snapcraft.io/obs-studio) is a good example of an application that needs access to your microphone/audio recording hardware.

```
$ sudo snap connect obs-studio:audio-record
```

## Developer details

**Auto-connect**: no

The design of this interface is based on the principle that the slot implementation of the audio service, such as [PulseAudio](https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/interfaces/pulseaudio-interface/), queries whether its audio-record slot is connected, leaving the audio service to mediate recording if it is.

On systems with snapd integration, PulseAudio's mediation is limited and will only verify that the *snap* is connected to `audio-record` and not if the specific snap command plugs the interface.

### Code examples

Mumble is a voice chat platform and a good example of an application using audio-record. Its snapcraft.yaml can be found here:

The source code for this interface is in the *snapd* repository:
