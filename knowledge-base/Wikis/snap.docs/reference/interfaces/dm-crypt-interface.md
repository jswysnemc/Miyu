#  dm-crypt interface

The `dm-crypt`  interface enables the following access functions to  [dm-crypt](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/device-mapper/dm-crypt.html) encrypted external block storage devices:

- setting up a LUKS partition
- locking and unlocking _dm-crypt_ partitions
- adding key(s) to kernel keyring
- formatting encrypted partition(s) ( creation of fs)
- mounting of encrypted partition(s)

## Developer details

**[Auto-connect](https://snapcraft.io/docs/explanation/interfaces/interface-auto-connection/)**: no

**[Super-privileged](https://snapcraft.io/docs/explanation/interfaces/super-privileged-interfaces/)**: yes

Often, _dm-crypt_ is statically linked into the kernel (`CONFIG_DM_CRYPT=y`). This is expected when working with custom kernels on projects where disk encryption is required.

### Code examples
