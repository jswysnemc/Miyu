# Exit codes
The `snap` command uses the following exit codes. These are useful when scripting `snap` operations or
diagnosing failures.

| 1   | General error | The command failed for a reason not covered by a more specific exit code. |
| 10  | Retryable error | Another snap operation is in progress resulting in a `snap-change-conflict`. Wait for it to finish and try again. |
| 20  | Build error | `mksquashfs` failed when building a snap (e.g. during `snap pack`). |
