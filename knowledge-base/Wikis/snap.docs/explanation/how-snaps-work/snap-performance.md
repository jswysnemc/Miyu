# Snap performance

The performance of a running application should not be affected by its snap environment, and any  performance or system monitoring tool will work on snapped processes in exactly the same way they would on other applications and processes.

But monitoring specific snap operations, alongside installation and distribution performance, can help with both snap _packaging_ and _configuration_ decisions, and also help to discover potential performance issues outside of an application's control. Several such approaches are outlined below.

On devices running Ubuntu Core, a [kernel boot parameter](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/kernel-boot-parameters#heading--bootchart) can be used to generate a bootchart showing system startup times and performance.

## Snap debug timing

Timing output from a snap can be a useful measure of overall performance, but it can also reveal performance bottlenecks and targets for improvement. The [snap debug](https://snapcraft.io/docs/how-to-guides/snap-development/debug-snaps/) command includes several options to produce timing output for execution time, internal _ensure_ activities and subsystem startup times.

### Execution time

By default, the `snap debug timings` command will produce timing output for a specific _change_, which itself represents a set of operations performed by the snap daemon.

The syntax for the command is as follows:

```
snap debug timings <change-id>
```

The change identifiers (`<change-id>`) are listed under the `ID` column in the output to `snap changes`:

```
ID    Status  Spawn                   Ready                   Summary
8302  Done    yesterday at 18:24 BST  yesterday at 18:24 BST  Install "chromium" snap
8303  Done    today at 11:46 BST      today at 11:46 BST      Remove hotplug connections and slots of device /dev/ttyACM0 (100 Series/C230 …; serial: 6564B3891339) with interface "serial-port"
8304  Done    today at 11:50 BST      today at 11:50 BST      Add hotplug slot of interface "/dev/ttyACM0 (100 Series/C230 …; serial: 6564B3891339)" for device serial-port with hotplug key "056a4e841487…"
```

Instead of a change id,  the `--last` argument can be used with a well defined name for a change, such as `auto-refresh`, `install`, `refresh`, `remove` or `try`.

With the `--verbose` argument, the output will also include a label for the change:

```
ID     Status Doing  Undoing  Label          Summary
160162 Done   750ms        -  prerequisites  Ensure prerequisites for "chromium" are available
^             681ms        -  install-prereq install "cups"
```

The ID represents a numerical identifier for tasks spawned by the change logic, with nested tasks denoted with the `^` symbol beneath their parent.

The following charts were produced from the `Doing` column output of  `snap debug timings --last=install` after installing the [Chromium snap](https://snapcraft.io/chromium), first from the cache, and secondly after a fresh install:

### Internal activities

Alongside the execution time for a *change*, the time a taken to process internal  _snapd_ activities, called *ensure activities*, is also tracked. Ensure activities are performed on a regular basis, and they occasionally generate new tasks, as changes, to continue an initial action. They include the following:

- `auto-refresh`
- `become-operational` (Ubuntu Core only)
- `install-system` (Ubuntu Core only)
- `refresh-catalogs`
- `refresh-hints`
- `seed` (Ubuntu Core only)

Tracking the execution times of such ensure activities can be useful. For example, *auto-refresh* involves multiple processes for various already-installed snaps, including connecting to the Snap Store. Timing information can therefore help troubleshoot refresh issues.

Use the `--ensure=` argument to see the timing details for the latest specified ensure activity, or with the optional `--all` argument to show timing data for every execution of the ensure activity.

```
$ snap debug timings --ensure=refresh-catalogs
ID                Status        Doing      Undoing  Summary
refresh-catalogs                309ms            -
 ^                               69ms            -    query store for sections
 ^                              170ms            -    query store for catalogs
```

## Subsystem startup times

The startup timing data for two subsystems, `load-state` and `ifacemgr`, are also tracked and can be output with the `--startup` argument:

```
$ snap debug timings --startup=ifacemgr
ID        Status        Doing      Undoing  Summary
ifacemgr                    -            -
 ^                        8ms            -    setup security backend "apparmor" for snap "core"
 ^                        7ms            -    setup security backend "mount" for snap "lxd"
 ^                       16ms            -    setup security backend "apparmor" for snap "lxd"
 ^                       12ms            -    load unchanged security profiles of snap "lxd"
 ^                        7ms            -    setup security backend "apparmor" for snap "vlc"
 ^                        5ms            -    load unchanged security profiles of snap "vlc"
```

The above example shows execution times related to snapd’s interface manager, which includes the time to set up the security profiles for all installed snaps and their interfaces before snapd becomes operational.

## SquashFS performance and compression

[SquashFS](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/squashfs.txt) is a standard Linux file system that encases an operational directory structure within a single compressed file. It’s commonly used to provide bootable live Linux environments on USB storage, but it’s also used to package a snap.

A snap is a SquashFS file that contains the library and binary environment for the snap, alongside the metadata to describe its access and capabilities. The SquashFS file is either mounted by _systemd_ when the snap is first installed, or during the early phases of the boot up for a system, such as Ubuntu Core, that already has snaps installed.

SquashFS decompression occurs when a snap is first run on a system and its performance has been closely monitored. In particular, decompression performance may differ according to the compression algorithm used, the size of the SquashFS archive, the number of files it contains, whether it’s being accessed for the first time (cold-cache) or whether it’s being accessed again (warm-cache).

Snaps can use one of two different types of compression, either `xz` or `lzo`, with the majority of snaps defaulting to `xz`. These algorithms were chosen for their compression ratios and speed when used with snaps that differ in the number of files they contain, and their size.

> Note:
> See [snapcraft.yaml compression](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/snapcraft/stable/reference/project-file/snapcraft-yaml/#compression) for schema details on how to build a snap using compression.

Chromium, for example, contains over 300MB across almost 1000 files and it takes significantly longer to access every file than it does to launch the application. In this case, the xz compression format is the slowest by more than double the next slowest format, gzip. This is shown in the following “box chart”, where each test was run 10 times across 6 different compression options. Each test itself is an aggregate of times for installation, running the application twice, and hashing every file in the SquashFS archive:

![Chromium SquashFS file walk speed](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/4d4454ed-perf-chromium-walk.png)

The decompression speed for both cold-cache (1) and warm-cache(2) access, across a range of compression algorithms, has also been tested. Again for Chromium, measuring start speed shows that xz initially performs very poorly when first launched, but improves significantly with subsequent launches:

![chromium warm cold access speed](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/998d84a9-compression-speed.png)

Compression ratios for various compression algorithms are also affected by the size of files inside the snap:

![compression ratios comparison](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/ddc43d34-compression-ratios-barchart.png)

These comparisons ultimately led to the addition of lzo as an optional compression algorithm, but its use with snaps is entirely dependent on the type and structure of the files within the SquashFS archive.
