NAME
     pvcreate —— Initialize physical volume(s) for use by LVM

SYNOPSIS
     pvcreate position_args
            [ option_args ]

DESCRIPTION
     pvcreate  initializes  a  Physical Volume (PV) on a device so the device is
     recognized as belonging to LVM.  This allows the PV to be used in a  Volume
     Group  (VG).   An LVM disk label is written to the device, and LVM metadata
     areas are initialized.  A PV can be placed on a whole device or partition.

     Use vgcreate(8) to create a new VG on the PV, or vgextend(8) to add the  PV
     to  an  existing VG.  Use pvremove(8) to remove the LVM disk label from the
     device.

     The force option will create a  PV  without  confirmation.   Repeating  the
     force  option  (-ff) will forcibly create a PV, overriding checks that nor‐
     mally prevent it, e.g. if the PV is already in a VG.

     Metadata location, size, and alignment

     The LVM disk label begins 512 bytes from the start of the  device,  and  is
     512 bytes in size.

     The  LVM  metadata  area begins at an offset (from the start of the device)
     equal to the page size of the machine creating the PV (often  4  KiB.)  The
     metadata  area  contains  a 512 byte header and a multi-KiB circular buffer
     that holds text copies of the VG metadata.

     With default settings, the first physical extent (PE),  which  contains  LV
     data,  is  1 MiB from the start of the device.  This location is controlled
     by default_data_alignment in lvm.conf, which is set to 1 (MiB) by  default.
     The  pe_start  will  be  a multiple of this many MiB.  This location can be
     checked with:
     pvs -o pe_start PV

     The size of the LVM metadata area is the space between  the  start  of  the
     metadata  area  and  the  first  PE.  When metadata begins at 4 KiB and the
     first PE is at 1024 KiB, the metadata area size is 1020 KiB.  This  can  be
     checked with:
     pvs -o mda_size PV

     The  mda_size  cannot be increased after pvcreate, so if larger metadata is
     needed, it must be set during pvcreate.  Two copies of the VG metadata must
     always fit within the metadata area, so the maximum  VG  metadata  size  is
     around half the mda_size.  This can be checked with:
     vgs -o mda_free VG

     A  larger  metadata  area  can  be  set with --metadatasize.  The resulting
     mda_size may be larger than specified due to default_data_alignment placing
     pe_start on a MiB boundary, and the fact that the metadata area extends  to
     the first PE.  With metadata starting at 4 KiB and default_data_alignment 1
     (MiB),  setting  --metadatasize  2048k  results  in  pe_start  of 3 MiB and
     mda_size of 3068  KiB.   Alternatively,  --metadatasize  2044k  results  in
     pe_start at 2 MiB and mda_size of 2044 KiB.

     The  alignment  of pe_start described above may be automatically overridden
     based on md device properties or device i/o properties reported  in  sysfs.
     These automatic adjustments can be enabled/disabled using lvm.conf settings
     md_chunk_alignment and data_alignment_offset_detection.

     To use a different pe_start alignment, use the --dataalignment option.  The
     --metadatasize option would also typically be used in this case because the
     metadata  area  size  also determines the location of pe_start.  When using
     these two options together, pe_start is calculated as: metadata area  start
     (page size), plus the specified --metadatasize, rounded up to the next mul‐
     tiple  of --dataalignment.  With metadata starting at 4 KiB, --metadatasize
     2048k, and --dataalignment 128k, pe_start  is  2176  KiB  and  mda_size  is
     2172 KiB.  The pe_start of 2176 KiB is the nearest even multiple of 128 KiB
     that  provides  at  least 2048 KiB of metadata space.  Always check the re‐
     sulting alignment and metadata size when using these options.

     To shift an aligned pe_start value, use the  --dataalignmentoffset  option.
     The pe_start alignment is calculated as described above, and then the value
     specified with --dataalignmentoffset is added to produce the final pe_start
     value.

OPTIONS
     --bootloaderareasize Size[m|UNIT]
            Reserve  space  for the bootloader between the LVM metadata area and
            the first PE.  The bootloader area is reserved  for  bootloaders  to
            embed  their  own  data or metadata; LVM will not use it.  The boot‐
            loader area begins where the first PE would  otherwise  be  located.
            The  first  PE  is moved out by the size of the bootloader area, and
            then moved out further if necessary to  match  the  data  alignment.
            The  start  of  the  bootloader  area  is  always  aligned, see also
            --dataalignment and --dataalignmentoffset. The bootloader  area  may
            be  larger  than requested due to the alignment, but it's never less
            than the requested size.  To see the bootloader area start and  size
            of an existing PV use pvs -o +pv_ba_start,pv_ba_size.

     --commandprofile String
            The   command   profile  to  use  for  command  configuration.   See
            lvm.conf(5) for more information about profiles.

     --config String
            Config settings for the command.  These  override  lvm.conf(5)  set‐
            tings.   The  String arg uses the same format as lvm.conf(5), or may
            use section/field syntax.   See  lvm.conf(5)  for  more  information
            about config.

     --dataalignment Size[k|UNIT]
            Align  the  start  of a PV data area with a multiple of this number.
            To see the location of the first Physical Extent (PE) of an existing
            PV, use pvs -o +pe_start. In addition,  it  may  be  shifted  by  an
            alignment offset, see --dataalignmentoffset.  Also specify an appro‐
            priate PE size when creating a VG.

     --dataalignmentoffset Size[k|UNIT]
            Shift the start of the PV data area by this additional offset.

     -d|--debug ...
            Set  debug level. Repeat from 1 to 6 times to increase the detail of
            messages sent to the log file and/or syslog (if configured).

     --devices PV
            Restricts the devices that are visible and accessible  to  the  com‐
            mand.  Devices not listed will appear to be missing. This option can
            be  repeated,  or  accepts  a  comma separated list of devices. This
            overrides the devices file.

     --devicesfile String
            A file listing devices that LVM should use.  The file must exist  in
            #DEFAULT_SYS_DIR#/devices/  and  is  managed  with the lvmdevices(8)
            command.  This overrides the lvm.conf(5) devices/devicesfile and de‐
            vices/use_devicesfile settings.

     --driverloaded y|n
            If set to no, the command will not  attempt  to  use  device-mapper.
            For testing and debugging.

     -f|--force ...
            Override  various  checks,  confirmations and protections.  Use with
            extreme caution.

     -h|--help
            Display help text.

     --journal String
            Record information in the systemd journal.  This information  is  in
            addition to information enabled by the lvm.conf log/journal setting.
            command:  record  information about the command.  output: record the
            default command output.  debug: record full command debugging.

     --labelsector Number
            By default the PV is labelled with an LVM2 identifier in its  second
            sector  (sector  1).  This  lets you use a different sector near the
            start of the disk (between 0 and 3 inclusive -  see  LABEL_SCAN_SEC‐
            TORS in the source). Use with care.

     --lockopt String
            Used to pass options for special cases to lvmlockd.  See lvmlockd(8)
            for more information.

     --longhelp
            Display long help text.

     --metadataignore y|n
            Specifies the metadataignore property of a PV.  If yes, metadata ar‐
            eas  on  the  PV are ignored, and lvm will not store metadata in the
            metadata areas of the PV.  If no, lvm will store metadata on the PV.

     --metadatasize Size[m|UNIT]
            The approximate amount of space used for each VG metadata area.  The
            size may be rounded.

     -M|--metadatatype lvm2
            Specifies the type of on-disk metadata to use.  lvm2 (or just 2)  is
            the current, standard format.  lvm1 (or just 1) is no longer used.

     --nohints
            Do  not  use the hints file to locate devices for PVs. A command may
            read more devices to find PVs when hints are not used.  The  command
            will  still  perform standard hint file invalidation where appropri‐
            ate.

     --nolocking
            Disable locking. Use with caution, concurrent commands  may  produce
            incorrect results.

     --norestorefile
            In conjunction with --uuid, this allows a uuid to be specified with‐
            out also requiring that a backup of the metadata be provided.

     --profile String
            An alias for --commandprofile or --metadataprofile, depending on the
            command.

     --[pv]metadatacopies 0|1|2
            The  number  of  metadata  areas to set aside on a PV for storing VG
            metadata.  When 2, one copy of the VG  metadata  is  stored  at  the
            front of the PV and a second copy is stored at the end.  When 1, one
            copy  of  the VG metadata is stored at the front of the PV.  When 0,
            no copies of the VG metadata are stored on the given PV.   This  may
            be useful in VGs containing many PVs (this places limitations on the
            ability to use vgsplit later.)

     -q|--quiet ...
            Suppress  output  and log messages. Overrides --debug and --verbose.
            Repeat once to also suppress any prompts with answer 'no'.

     --reportformat basic|json|json_std
            Overrides current output format for reports which is  defined  glob‐
            ally  by  the report/output_format setting in lvm.conf(5).  basic is
            the original format with columns and rows.  If there  is  more  than
            one report per command, each report is prefixed with the report name
            for  identification.  json  produces  report  output in JSON format.
            json_std produces report output in JSON format which is more compli‐
            ant with JSON standard.  See lvmreport(7) for more information.

     --restorefile String
            In conjunction with --uuid, this reads the file (produced by  vgcfg‐
            backup),  extracts  the location and size of the data on the PV, and
            ensures that the metadata produced by the program is consistent with
            the contents of the file, i.e. the physical extents will be  in  the
            same  place  and not be overwritten by new metadata. This provides a
            mechanism to upgrade the metadata format or to  add/remove  metadata
            areas. Use with care.

     --setphysicalvolumesize Size[m|UNIT]
            Overrides the automatically detected size of the PV.  Use with care,
            or prior to reducing the physical size of the device.

     -t|--test
            Run in test mode. Commands will not update metadata.  This is imple‐
            mented  by disabling all metadata writing but nevertheless returning
            success to the calling function. This may lead to unusual error mes‐
            sages in multi-stage operations if a tool  relies  on  reading  back
            metadata it believes has changed but hasn't.

     -u|--uuid String
            Specify  a  UUID for the device.  Without this option, a random UUID
            is generated.  This option is needed before restoring  a  backup  of
            LVM  metadata  onto  a  replacement  device; see vgcfgrestore(8). As
            such, use of --restorefile is compulsory unless the  --norestorefile
            is  used.  All PVs must have unique UUIDs, and LVM will prevent cer‐
            tain operations if multiple devices are seen  with  the  same  UUID.
            See vgimportclone(8) for more information.

     -v|--verbose ...
            Set  verbose  level. Repeat from 1 to 4 times to increase the detail
            of messages sent to stdout and stderr.

     --version
            Display version information.

     -y|--yes
            Do not prompt for confirmation interactively but always  assume  the
            answer yes. Use with extreme caution.  (For automatic no, see -qq.)

     -Z|--zero y|n
            Controls  if  the  first  4  sectors  (2048 bytes) of the device are
            wiped.  The default is to wipe these sectors unless either  or  both
            of --restorefile or --uuid are specified.

VARIABLES
     PV     Physical Volume name, a device path under /dev.  For commands manag‐
            ing physical extents, a PV positional arg generally accepts a suffix
            indicating  a  range (or multiple ranges) of physical extents (PEs).
            When the first PE is omitted, it defaults to the start  of  the  de‐
            vice, and when the last PE is omitted it defaults to end.
            Start and end range (inclusive): PV[:PE-PE] ...
            Start and length range (counting from 0): PV[:PE+PE] ...

     String
            See the option description for information about the string content.

     Size[UNIT]
            Size  is an input number that accepts an optional unit.  Input units
            are always treated as base two values, regardless of capitalization,
            e.g. 'k' and 'K' both refer to 1024.   The  default  input  unit  is
            specified  by letter, followed by |UNIT.  UNIT represents other pos‐
            sible input units: b|B is bytes, s|S is sectors of 512 bytes, k|K is
            KiB, m|M is MiB, g|G is GiB, t|T is TiB, p|P is  PiB,  e|E  is  EiB.
            (This  should not be confused with the output control --units, where
            capital letters mean multiple of 1000.)

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
     See lvm(8) for information about environment variables used  by  lvm.   For
     example, LVM_VG_NAME can generally be substituted for a required VG parame‐
     ter.
