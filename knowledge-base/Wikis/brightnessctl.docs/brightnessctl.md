# NAME

brightnessctl - read and control device brightness

# SYNOPSIS

*brightnessctl* \[options\] *\[operation\]* \[value...\]

# OPTIONS

**-h, --help**

> Print this help.

**-l, --list**

> List devices with available brightness controls.

**-q, --quiet**

> Suppress output.

**-p, --pretend**

> Do not perform write operations.

**-m, --machine-readable**

> Produce machine-readable output.

**-P, --percentage**

> Display value as a percentage in get.

**-n, --min-value**=*\[VALUE\]*

> Set minimum brightness when using delta values. VALUE is set to 1 when not provided.

**-e, --exponent**=*K*

> Changes percentage scaling curve to exponential (linear by default). Default exponent is 4.
>
> Percentage equation: % = *\[VALUE\]*^*\[K\]* \* *\[MAX\]* \* 100^-*\[K\]*.
>
> The exponential curve may make the adjustments perceptually equal.

**-s, --save**

> Save state in a temporary file.

**-r, --restore**

> Restore previously-saved state.

**-d, --device**=*DEVICE*

> Specify device name (can be a wildcard).
>
> If device is specified as **'\*'**, only **brightness** class devices are selected.

**-c, --class**=*CLASS*

> Specify device class.

**-V, --version**

> Print version and exit.

# OPERATIONS

**i, info**

> Get device info.

**g, get**

> Get the current brightness of the device.

**m, max**

> Get the maximum brightness of the device.

**s, set** *VALUE*

> Set the brightness of the device.

## VALUES

You may specify *VALUE* for the **set** command in absolute or relative form, and as a value or a delta from the current value. For example:

**brightnessctl set 500**

> Sets brightness to 500.

**brightnessctl set 50%**

> Sets brightness to 50% of the maximum.

**brightnessctl set 50-**

> Subtracts 50 from the current brightness.

**brightnessctl set +10**

> Adds 10 to the current brightness.

**brightnessctl set 50%-**

> Subtracts 50% of the maximum from the current brightness.

**brightnessctl set +10%**

> Adds 10% of the maximum to the current brightness.
