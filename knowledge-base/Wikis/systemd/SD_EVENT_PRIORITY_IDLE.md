## Description

`sd_event_source_set_priority()` may be used to set the priority for the event source object specified as *`source`*. The priority is specified as an arbitrary signed 64-bit integer. The priority is initialized to `SD_EVENT_PRIORITY_NORMAL` (0) when the event source is allocated with a call such as sd_event_add_io(3) or sd_event_add_time(3), and may be changed with this call. If multiple event sources have seen events at the same time, they are dispatched in the order indicated by the event sources' priorities. Event sources with smaller priority values are dispatched first. As well-known points of reference, the constants `SD_EVENT_PRIORITY_IMPORTANT` (-100), `SD_EVENT_PRIORITY_NORMAL` (0) and `SD_EVENT_PRIORITY_IDLE` (100) may be used to indicate event sources that shall be dispatched early, normally or late. It is recommended to specify priorities based on these definitions, and relative to them — however, the full 64-bit signed integer range is available for ordering event sources.

Priorities define the order in which event sources that have seen events are dispatched. Care should be taken to ensure that high-priority event sources (those with negative priority values assigned) do not cause starvation of low-priority event sources (those with positive priority values assigned).

The order in which event sources with the same priority are dispatched is undefined, but the event loop generally tries to dispatch them in the order it learnt about events on them. As the backing kernel primitives do not provide accurate information about the order in which events occurred this is not necessarily reliable. However, it is guaranteed that if events are seen on multiple same-priority event sources at the same time, each one is not dispatched again until all others have been dispatched once. This behavior guarantees that within each priority particular event sources do not starve or dominate the event loop.

The priority of event sources may be changed at any time of their lifetime, with the exception of inotify event sources (i.e. those created with sd_event_add_inotify(3)) whose priority may only be changed in the time between their initial creation and the first subsequent event loop iteration.

`sd_event_source_get_priority()` may be used to query the current priority assigned to the event source object *`source`*.

## Return Value

On success, `sd_event_source_set_priority()` and `sd_event_source_get_priority()` return a non-negative integer. On failure, they return a negative errno-style error code.

### Errors

Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

`-EINVAL`  
*`source`* is not a valid pointer to an sd_event_source object.

`-ENOMEM`  
Not enough memory.

`-ESTALE`  
The event loop is already terminated.

`-ECHILD`  
The event loop has been created in a different process, library or module instance.

## Notes

Functions described here are available as a shared library, which can be compiled against and linked to with the `libsystemd` pkg-config(1) file.

The code described here uses getenv(3), which is declared to be not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling the functions described here must not call setenv(3) from a parallel thread. It is recommended to only do calls to `setenv()` from an early phase of the program when no other threads have been started.

## History

`sd_event_source_set_priority()` and `sd_event_source_get_priority()` were added in version 229.
