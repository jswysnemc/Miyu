## Description

These files configure various parameters of systemd-journal-remote.service(8). See systemd.syntax(7) for a general description of the syntax.

## Configuration Directories and Precedence

The default configuration is set during compilation, so configuration is only needed when it is necessary to deviate from those defaults. The main configuration file is loaded from one of the listed directories in order of priority, only the first file found is used: `/etc/systemd/`, `/run/systemd/`, `/usr/local/lib/systemd/` <sup>\[1\]</sup>, `/usr/lib/systemd/`. The vendor version of the file contains commented out entries showing the defaults as a guide to the administrator. Local overrides can also be created by creating drop-ins, as described below. The main configuration file can also be edited for this purpose (or a copy in `/etc/` if it is shipped under `/usr/`), however using drop-ins for local configuration is recommended over modifications to the main configuration file.

In addition to the main configuration file, drop-in configuration snippets are read from `/usr/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/`, `/usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/`, and `/etc/systemd/*.conf.d/`. Those drop-ins have higher precedence and override the main configuration file. Files in the `*.conf.d/` configuration subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the subdirectories they reside. When multiple files specify the same option, for options which accept just a single value, the entry in the file sorted last takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of values, entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files.

When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install drop-ins under `/usr/`. Files in `/etc/` are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files installed by vendor packages. Drop-ins have to be used to override package drop-ins, since the main configuration file has lower precedence. It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a two-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering. This also defines a concept of drop-in priorities to allow OS vendors to ship drop-ins within a specific range lower than the range used by users. This should lower the risk of package drop-ins overriding accidentally drop-ins defined by users. It is recommended to use the range 10-40 for drop-ins in `/usr/` and the range 60-90 for drop-ins in `/etc/` and `/run/`, to make sure that local and transient drop-ins take priority over drop-ins shipped by the OS vendor.

To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to `/dev/null` in the configuration directory in `/etc/`, with the same filename as the vendor configuration file.

## Options

All options are configured in the \[Remote\] section:

`Seal=`  
Periodically sign the data in the journal using Forward Secure Sealing.

Added in version 229.

`SplitMode=`  
One of "`host`" or "`none`".

Added in version 220.

`ServerKeyFile=`  
SSL key in PEM format.

Added in version 220.

`ServerCertificateFile=`  
SSL certificate in PEM format.

Added in version 220.

`TrustedCertificateFile=`  
SSL CA certificate.

Added in version 220.

`MaxUse=`, `KeepFree=`, `MaxFileSize=`, `MaxFiles=`  
These are analogous to `SystemMaxUse=`, `SystemKeepFree=`, `SystemMaxFileSize=` and `SystemMaxFiles=` in journald.conf(5).

`MaxUse=` controls how much disk space the **systemd-journal-remote** may use up at most. `KeepFree=` controls how much disk space **systemd-journal-remote** shall leave free for other uses. **systemd-journal-remote** will respect both limits and use the smaller of the two values.

`MaxFiles=` controls how many individual journal files to keep at most. Note that only archived files are deleted to reduce the number of files until this limit is reached; active files will stay around. This means that, in effect, there might still be more journal files around in total than this limit after a vacuuming operation is complete.

Added in version 253.

`Compression=`  
Configurs acceptable compression algorithms to be announced through "`Accept-Encoding`" HTTP header. The header suggests **systemd-journal-upload** to compress data to be sent. Takes a space separated list of compression algorithms, or "`no`". Supported algorithms are "`zstd`", "`xz`", or "`lz4`". When a list of algorithms is specified, "`Accept-Encoding`" header will be constructed with priorities based on the order of the algorithms in the list. When "`no`", "`Accept-Encoding`" header will not be sent. This option can be specified multiple times. If an empty string is assigned, then all the previous assignments are cleared. Defaults to unset and all supported compression algorithms will be listed in the header.

Example:

``` programlisting
Compression=zstd lz4
```

Added in version 258.

<sup>\[1\]</sup> 💣💥🧨💥💥💣 Please note that those configuration files must be available at all times. If `/usr/local/` is a separate partition, it may not be available during early boot, and must not be used for configuration.
