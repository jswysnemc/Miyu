## Name

poweroff, reboot, halt — Power off, reboot, or halt the machine

## Synopsis

`poweroff` \[OPTIONS...\]

`reboot` \[OPTIONS...\]

`halt` \[OPTIONS...\]

## Description

**poweroff**, **reboot**, and **halt** may be used to power off, reboot, or halt the machine. All three commands take the same options.

## Options

The following options are understood:

`--help`  
Print a short help text and exit.

Added in version 253.

`--halt`  
Halt the machine, regardless of which one of the three commands is invoked.

Added in version 253.

`-p`, `--poweroff`  
Power off the machine, when either **halt** or **poweroff** is invoked. This option is ignored when **reboot** is invoked.

Added in version 253.

`--reboot`  
Reboot the machine, regardless of which one of the three commands is invoked.

Added in version 253.

`-f`, `--force`  
Force immediate power-off, halt, or reboot. If specified, the command does not contact the init system. In most cases, filesystems are not properly unmounted before shutdown. For example, the command **reboot -f** is mostly equivalent to **systemctl reboot -ff**, instead of **systemctl reboot -f**.

Added in version 253.

`-w`, `--wtmp-only`  
Only write wtmp shutdown entry, do not actually power off, reboot, or halt.

Added in version 253.

`-d`, `--no-wtmp`  
Do not write wtmp shutdown entry.

Added in version 253.

`-n`, `--no-sync`  
Do not sync hard disks/storage media before power-off, reboot, or halt.

Added in version 253.

`--no-wall`  
Do not send wall message before power-off, reboot, or halt.

Added in version 253.

## Exit status

On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.

## Notes

These commands are implemented in a way that preserves basic compatibility with the original SysV commands. systemctl(1) verbs **poweroff**, **reboot**, **halt** provide the same functionality with some additional features.

Note that on many SysV systems **halt** used to be synonymous to **poweroff**, i.e. both commands would equally result in powering the machine off. systemd is more accurate here, and **halt** results in halting the machine only (leaving power on), and **poweroff** is required to actually power it off.
