# NAME

sane-leo - SANE backend for LEO Technologies scanners

# DESCRIPTION

The **sane-leo** library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to some LEO SCSI flatbed scanners. This backend should be considered **beta-quality** software! LEO scanners were also sold under the Across Technologies brand.

The scanners that should work with this backend are:

>    Vendor Model           status
>     ----------------------  -----------
>       Across FS-1130          tested
>       LEO S3                  tested

The options the backend supports can either be selected through command line options to programs like **scanimage**(1) or through GUI elements in **xscanimage**(1) or **xsane**(1).


If you have any strange behavior, please report to the backend maintainer or to the SANE mailing list.

Valid command line options and their syntax can be listed by using

> scanimage --help -d leo

**Scan Mode**
**--mode**
selects the basic mode of operation of the scanner. Valid choices are *Black & White*, *Grayscale* and *Color*. The *Black & White* mode is black and white only (1 bit). *Grayscale* mode will produce 256 levels of gray (8 bits). *Color* mode will produce a 24 bit color image.


**--resolution**
selects the resolution for a scan. The scanner can do all resolutions between 1 and 300, in increments of 1.


**Geometry options**
**-l -t -x -y**
control the scan area: -l sets the top left x coordinate, -t the top left y coordinate, -x selects the width and -y the height of the scan area. All parameters are specified in millimeters by default.


**Enhancement options**
**--custom-gamma**
(grayscale and color mode only) allows the user to specify a gamma table (see the next 3 parameters).


**--red-gamma-table**
(color mode only) can be used to download a user defined gamma table for the red channel. The table must be 256 bytes long.


**--green-gamma-table**
(color mode only) can be used to download a user defined gamma table for the green channel. The table must be 256 bytes long.


**--blue-gamma-table**
(color mode only) can be used to download a user defined gamma table for the blue channel. The table must be 256 bytes long.


**--halftone**
(Black & White only) select the halftone mask to use. Possible values are *Diamond*, *8x8 Coarse Fatting*, *8x8 Fine Fatting*, *8x8 Bayer* and *8x8 Vertical Line*.


**--preview**
requests a preview scan. The resolution used for that scan is 28 dpi and the scan area is the maximum allowed. The scan mode is user selected. The default is "no".

# CONFIGURATION FILE

The configuration file *@CONFIGDIR@/leo.conf* supports only one information: the device name to use (eg */dev/scanner*).

# FILES

*@LIBDIR@/libsane-leo.a*
The static library implementing this backend.

*@LIBDIR@/libsane-leo.so*
The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that support dynamic loading).

# ENVIRONMENT

**SANE_DEBUG_LEO**
If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this environment variable controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of 128 requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels reduce verbosity.

# LIMITATIONS

The windows TWAIN driver has many more options than this SANE backend. However they are only software adjustments. This backend only implements what the scanner can support.

# BUGS

None known.
