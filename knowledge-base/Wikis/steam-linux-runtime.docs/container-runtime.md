# Introduction to the Steam container runtime framework

The Steam container runtime framework, often referred to as
*Steam Linux Runtime*, is a collection of container environments
which can be used to run Steam games on Linux in a relatively predictable
container environment, even when running on an arbitrary Linux
distribution which might be old, new or unusually set up.

Instead of forming a `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` that merges the host OS's shared
libraries with the shared libraries provided by Valve, these new runtimes
use Linux namespace (container) technology to build a more predictable
environment.

It is implemented as a collection of Steam Play compatibility tools.

More technical background on this work is available in a talk recorded at
FOSDEM 2020:
<https://archive.fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/containers_steam/>.
Many of the features described as future work in that talk have now been
implemented and are in active use.

## `pressure-vessel`

The core of all of these compatibility tools is
[pressure-vessel][],
which combines application-level libraries from the Steam Runtime
with graphics drivers from the host operating system, resulting in a
system that is as compatible as possible with the Steam Runtime
while still having all the necessary graphics drivers to work with recent
GPU hardware.

The Steam Play compatibility tools automatically run pressure-vessel
when necessary.

## Steam Linux Runtime 4.0 (steamrt4)

[steamrt4]: #steamrt4

Steam Linux Runtime 4.0, `steamrt4`,
is a new runtime environment for native Linux games on Steam.
It can be used by any game that benefits from a newer library stack
or SDK environment.

It is based on Debian 13 (released in 2025).
Most of its libraries are taken directly from Debian, and can benefit
from Debian's long-term security support.
Selected libraries that are particularly important for games, such as
SDL and Vulkan-Loader, have been upgraded to newer versions backported
from newer branches of Debian.

For backwards compatibility,
the default runtime environment for existing native Linux games is
[Steam Linux Runtime 1.0 (scout)][scout-on-soldier].
To opt-in to using steamrt4,
app and game developers should compile their titles in the
[steamrt4 SDK][]
and reconfigure the title's metadata to ask Steam to run it with
*Steam Linux Runtime 4.0*.
For more information please see
[Steam Linux Runtime - guide for game developers][SLR for game developers].

steamrt4 is also used as a runtime environment for Proton version 11 and up,
which are compiled against this newer library stack.

The *Steam Linux Runtime 4.0* compatibility tool, app ID 4183110,
will automatically be downloaded to your Steam library as
`steamapps/common/SteamLinuxRuntime_4` if a game or a version of
Proton requires it.
It can also be installed by running this command:

    steam steam://install/4183110

For games that run natively on arm64 (aarch64), the
*Steam Linux Runtime 4.0 - Arm64* compatibility tool is used instead,
and can be installed with `steam steam://install/4185400`.
This version installs into `steamapps/common/SteamLinuxRuntime_4-arm64`.

Documentation in the `steamrt` "metapackage" provides
[more information about steamrt4][steamrt4 README].

## Steam Linux Runtime 3.0 (sniper)

[sniper]: #sniper

Steam Linux Runtime 3.0, `sniper`,
is a recommended runtime environment for new native Linux games on Steam
(early adopters should consider using [steamrt4][] instead).
It can be used by any game that benefits from a newer library stack
or SDK environment.

It is structurally similar to [steamrt4][],
but based on Debian 11 (released in 2021).

For backwards compatibility,
the default runtime environment for existing native Linux games is
[Steam Linux Runtime 1.0 (scout)][scout-on-soldier].
To opt-in to using sniper,
app and game developers should compile their titles in the
[sniper SDK][]
and reconfigure the title's metadata to ask Steam to run it with
*Steam Linux Runtime 3.0 (soldier)*.
For more information please see
[Steam Linux Runtime - guide for game developers][SLR for game developers].

Games that use sniper include Valve's
Counter-Strike 2,
Dota 2 and
Team Fortress 2,
and third-party titles like
Battle for Wesnoth,
Endless Sky and
Retroarch.

sniper is also used as a runtime environment for Proton versions 8, 9 and 10.

The *Steam Linux Runtime 3.0 - sniper* compatibility tool, app ID 1628350,
will automatically be downloaded to your Steam library as
`steamapps/common/SteamLinuxRuntime_sniper` if a game or a version of
Proton requires it.
It can also be installed by running this command:

    steam steam://install/1628350

Documentation in the `steamrt` "metapackage" provides
[more information about sniper][sniper README].

## Steam Linux Runtime 2.0 (soldier)

[soldier]: #soldier

Steam Runtime 2, `soldier`,
is a runtime environment based on Debian 10 (released in 2019).

This runtime environment is not directly available for use by game developers,
but it forms part of the implementation of the
[*Steam Linux Runtime 1.0 (scout)*][scout-on-soldier]
compatibility tool.
Proton versions 5.13 to 7.0 (inclusive) also use this runtime environment.

The *Steam Linux Runtime 2.0 (soldier)* compatibility tool, app ID 1391110,
is automatically downloaded to your Steam library as
`steamapps/common/SteamLinuxRuntime_soldier` when you select a version
of Proton that requires it, or the *Steam Linux Runtime 1.0 (scout)*
compatibility tool which requires it (see below).
It can also be installed by running this command:

    steam steam://install/1391110

Documentation in the `steamrt` "metapackage" provides
[more information about soldier][soldier README].

## Steam Linux Runtime 1.0 (scout)

[scout-on-soldier]: #scout-on-soldier

Steam offers a large number of older native Linux games.
Some of these games, such as Portal, were carefully compiled in
a strict `scout` environment, so that they can run in the
[scout `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` runtime][ldlp],
or in any environment that provides at least the same libraries as scout.

Unfortunately, many native Linux games have been compiled in a newer
environment, and will only work in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` runtime
if the host operating system happens to provide libraries that are newer
than the ones in `scout`, while still being compatible with the game's
assumptions.
This is not a stable situation: a game that happened to work in Ubuntu
22.04 could easily be broken by a routine upgrade to Ubuntu 24.04.
For example,
a game that was compiled in 2022 against a then-current version of `libtiff`
might have a dependency on `libtiff.so.5`,
which was included in Ubuntu 22.04,
but Ubuntu 24.04 no longer provides that library because it has upgraded
to the newer `libtiff.so.6`,
which does not have full ABI compatibility with `libtiff.so.5`.

The *Steam Linux Runtime 1.0 (scout)* compatibility tool, app ID 1070560,
uses the same container technology as the runtimes above
to mitigate this problem.
It will automatically be downloaded to your Steam library as
`steamapps/common/SteamLinuxRuntime` if it is selected to run a particular
game, or if a game requires it.
It can also be installed by running this command:

    steam steam://install/1070560

Unlike the newer container runtimes,
it is implemented by entering a [`soldier`](#soldier) container, and then
setting up a [`scout``LD_LIBRARY_PATH` runtime][ldlp] inside that container.

Since [November 2024][Steam client 2024-11-05],
it is the default for most native Linux games,
unless the game developer has configured the game to use a different
runtime environment.

Users can also specifically opt-in to running specific games in the
Steam Linux Runtime 1.0 (scout) container via *Properties* → *Compatibility*.

## Special-purpose Steam Runtime branches

### Steam client runtime 3 (steamrt3c)

[steamrt3c]: #steamrt3c

Steam client runtime 3 (`steamrt3c`) is a miniaturized version of [sniper][],
used internally by components of the Steam client.
It is installed in `$HOME/.steam/root/steamrt64/steam-runtime-steamrt`.
Older versions of the Steam client used sniper for this purpose.

Documentation in the `steamrt` "metapackage" provides
[more information about steamrt3c][steamrt3c README].

Game developers should use [sniper][] or [steamrt4][] instead.

## Possible future Steam Runtime branches

[steamrt5]: #steamrt5

Steam Runtime 5 is a prototype runtime currently based on Debian testing.
It is structurally similar to `sniper` and `steamrt4`,
but with a newer base distribution.

## Discontinued Steam Runtime branches

medic was a codename for an earlier attempt at Steam Runtime 4,
based on Debian 12 (released in mid 2023).
It was superseded by the Debian-13-based [steamrt4][],
and we do not plan to release a Debian-12-based runtime.

spy was an earlier attempt at Steam Runtime 2,
based on Ubuntu 18.04.
It was superseded by the Debian-10-based [soldier][] runtime.

## Why the container runtimes are necessary

[why]: #why

The [legacy `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` runtime][ldlp]
only works because modern host OSs are strictly newer than it.
Making a `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`-based runtime reliable is difficult, especially
since we want it to be runnable on host OSs that have some packages that
are older than the runtime, allowing users of older LTS distributions to
run the latest games.

Some libraries cannot be bundled in a `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for technical
reasons (mainly glibc and graphics drivers). A `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` runtime
needs to get these from the host system, and they need to be at least the
version it was compiled against. This is fine for scout, which is very
old, but would not be OK for a Debian 10-based runtime, which wouldn't work
on (for example) Ubuntu 18.04.

Some libraries *can* be bundled, but need to be patched to search for
plugins in different places (either inside the runtime itself, or in
multiple distro-dependent places), which is not really sustainable.
Avoiding the need to patch these libraries greatly reduces the time
required to update them, ensuring that we can apply security and
bug-fix updates as needed.

Using namespace (container) technology to replace `/usr` with the
runtime's libraries sidesteps both these problems.

## Acknowledgements

The libraries included in the container runtimes are derived
from [Debian][] and [Ubuntu][]
packages, and indirectly from various upstream projects.
See the copyright information included in the Steam Runtime for details.

The container technology used in `pressure-vessel` is heavily based on
code from [Flatpak][], and makes use of the
lower-level components [bubblewrap][] and [libcapsule][].
libcapsule is heavily based on internal code from glibc's dynamic linker,
and of course, all of this container/namespace juggling relies on features
contributed to the Linux kernel.
