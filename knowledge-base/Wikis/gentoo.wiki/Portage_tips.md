[[]][Package information](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sys-apps/portage)

**emerge** is the main command-line interface to [Portage](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage "Portage"), the Gentoo package manager.

[emerge] is used to download, install, update, and maintain software packages on Gentoo Linux.

[emerge] is a very powerful and flexible command that can, among other things, [automatically build and install packages \"from source\"](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Ebuild "Ebuild"), fetch and install \"ready-to-use\" [binary packages](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Gentoo_Binary_Host_Quickstart "Gentoo Binary Host Quickstart"), create binary packages, search for packages, report system information, etc.

** Tip**\
The [emerge] command has *many* possible options. For extensive documentation and a complete list of all options see [man emerge].

** See also**\

See the [Portage](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage "Portage") article for Portage usage beyond the emerge command.

The [working with Gentoo](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Full/Working "Handbook:AMD64/Full/Working") and [working with Portage](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Full/Portage "Handbook:AMD64/Full/Portage") chapters of the handbook have sections on using the [emerge] command.

Some common questions about the [emerge] command are answered in the [FAQ](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/FAQ "FAQ") and in the [Portage FAQ](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Portage/FAQ "Project:Portage/FAQ").

## [Usage]

### [Invocation]

The [emerge] command should be followed by appropriate options, actions, and package or set of packages. If [emerge] is invoked without any parameters or package, it will print a help text and exit.

For most uses [emerge] will need to be executed with [superuser privileges](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Sudo "Sudo"), though when used simply to report information it may be possible to run it as an unprivileged user.

If [emerge] is invoked with a package and no other options, it will **immediately** attempt to install the corresponding package **without requesting confirmation from the user**. This is often not the desired behavior, so one of the following options will probably be required.

The `--ask` (`-a`) and `--pretend` (`-p`) options allow examination of the planned system changes before they are actually made. The `--ask` option will make [emerge] display the intended changes and ask for confirmation before continuing. The `--pretend` option will simply display the intended changes and halt, and does not require superuser privileges.

** Warning**\
When using the `--ask` option, an accidental press of the [Enter] key during processing will result in the confirmation prompt being skipped. See the `--ask` option section of [man emerge] for more information.

[emerge] provides rich output, with information and warnings about individual packages and the system as a whole. The `--verbose` option is useful to have Portage show even more information, such as what [USE flags](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/USE_flag "USE flag") will be used to install or update a package, what USE flags are available for each package, the size of the package download, [overlay](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Ebuild_repository "Ebuild repository") name.

Running emerge with the `--help` option provides information on command line options:

`user `[`$`]`emerge --help`

    Actions:  [ --depclean | --list-sets | --search | --sync | --version        ]

    For more help consult the man page.

Below is an example invocation of [emerge], installing \"package\". The options `-atv` are short options for `--ask` (see above), `--tree` (display the dependency tree of packages to be installed), and `--verbose` (see above). Hover the mouse cursor over the red dotted boxes to see an explanation of each section of output:

[\#] emerge -[a][t][v] package

[These are the packages that would be merged, in reverse order:]

Calculating dependencies\... done! \[[ebuild] **[ ][ ] [U] [ ]**\] [**[category/package]-[3.0]-[r2]::gentoo**] [**\[2.0::gentoo\]**] USE=\"**[enabled] [-disabled] [toggled][\*] [new][%] ([-unavailable])**\" MAKE_OPTIONS=\"**[-disabled]**\" 777 kB \[[ebuild] **[ ][ ] [U][D]** \] [[category/package]-2.0[::gentoo]] [**\[3.0::gentoo\]**] 777 kB \[[ebuild] **[ ][R] [ ][ ]**\] [category/package-1.0::gentoo] 777 kB \[[ebuild] **[N][ ] [ ][ ]**\] [category/package-0.5::some-overlay-name] 777 kB

**Would you like to merge these packages?** \[[Yes]/[No]\]

The *U* symbol shows a package that will be upgraded, *D* a package that will be downgraded, *R* re-emerged, *N* a new package. In square brackets is the version of the previously installed package. Packages present in the world file are shown in bold - these are the user-installed packages, the other packages will be dependencies, or from the [system set](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/System_set_(Portage) "System set (Portage)").

** See also**\
See the *OUTPUT* section, `--verbose`, and `--pretend` options of the emerge man page for complete explanation of how to read Portage output.

In the context of Portage, the term \"package\" can have a similar meaning to \"atom\", see [version specifier](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Version_specifier "Version specifier").

### [Install a package]

Packages are installed (\"emerged\") using the [emerge] command followed by a [version specifier](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Version_specifier "Version specifier") that indicates which package to install (and optionally a specific version, slot, and from which [ebuild repository](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Ebuild_repository "Ebuild repository")). [emerge] is executed with [root privileges](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Sudo "Sudo").

Package functionality is governed by [USE flags](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/USE_flag "USE flag") which can be set or unset depending on the intended use of a piece of software by editing their configuration in [/etc/portage/package.use](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/package.use "/etc/portage/package.use").

** Tip**\
The `--ask` (`-a`) option is very useful, it will allow the emerge actions to be reviewed before the actual operation begins. The `--verbose` (`-v`) option will show more detailed information about what Portage will do, and is often helpful. Options can be [set as default](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/make.conf#EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS "/etc/portage/make.conf"), if desired. Default options can be overridden on the command line, for example `--ask=n`.

** Warning**\
If the `--ask` option is not provided, requested actions will be performed without asking for confirmation. The `--pretend` option may also be used.

** Note**\
Some things, such as dependencies, should not be installed in this way. See [do not add dependencies to the world file](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Emerge#Do_not_add_dependencies_to_the_world_file "Emerge") section.

As an example, install the [[[net-proxy/tinyproxy]](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/net-proxy/tinyproxy)[]] package with `--ask` and `--verbose` options:

`root `[`#`]`emerge --ask --verbose net-proxy/tinyproxy`

### [Search for packages]

** Note**\
The [emerge] command\'s built-in search function described here may show limited results compared to other tools. The *Latest version available* is constrained by [ACCEPT_KEYWORDS](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/ACCEPT_KEYWORDS "ACCEPT KEYWORDS") (derived from the current [profile](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Profile_(Portage) "Profile (Portage)"), [make.conf](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/make.conf "/etc/portage/make.conf"), [package.accept_keywords](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/package.accept_keywords "/etc/portage/package.accept keywords"), etc.). In addition, the *Latest version available* and the *Latest installed version* are not slot-aware, so they will not show multiple versions by slot. This can lead to some confusion when tools like [eix](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Eix "Eix") or [eshowkw](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Gentoolkit#eshowkw "Gentoolkit") might show more results than [emerge \--search].

** See also**\
See also [eix](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Eix "Eix"), [equery](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Equery "Equery"), and [packages.gentoo.org](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Packages.gentoo.org "Packages.gentoo.org") for more advanced ways to search for packages.

Search for packages with *proxy* in their names:

`user `[`$`]`emerge --search proxy`

Search for packages with *proxy* in their names or description:

`user `[`$`]`emerge --searchdesc proxy`

Search packages using a regular expression:

`user `[`$`]`emerge -s '%^python$'`

List all packages in a category:

`user `[`$`]`emerge -s '@^net-ftp/'`

### [][Remove (uninstall / depclean) packages]

To uninstall a package in Gentoo is colloquially said to **depclean** them. The `--depclean` (`-c`) option will remove the specified packages.

The depclean option will not remove any packages that are currently dependencies of other installed packages, of the [\@system](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Package_sets#.40system "Package sets"), or [\@profile](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Package_sets#.40profile "Package sets") sets.

** Important**\
Make sure to **review the list of packages** that `--depclean` would remove by using the `--ask` or `--pretend` options.

`--depclean` will remove dependencies that become superfluous due to the specified packages being uninstalled, any orphaned packages that might have been present on the system, and any packages that were only present on the system as a consequence of being the default dependency of a [virtual package](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Virtual_packages "Virtual packages") if another package that provides the virtual dependency has been installed. Sometimes, a package present on a system purely through one of these mechanisms may have become expected to be available, even though it has never been specifically installed (included in the [\@world](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Package_sets#.40world "Package sets") set). In such cases it may be desirable to use the `--noreplace` option to add such packages to the world set.

Some Portage operations, such as [system updates](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Upgrading_Gentoo "Upgrading Gentoo"), can sometimes orphan important packages (for example compilers or kernels), for example when a more recent version of such a core package gets emerged but before the user performs the steps to transition the system to use the latest version. Using the `--depclean` option in such cases can try to **remove vital system packages**. Take particular care not to remove for example current kernel sources or a required version of GCC.

Here is an example of removing the [[[net-proxy/tinyproxy]](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/net-proxy/tinyproxy)[]] package:

`root `[`#`]`emerge --ask --verbose --depclean net-proxy/tinyproxy`

An alternative to using `--depclean` to uninstall packages, is to use [emerge \--deselect] (or `-W` option), then cleaning out orphaned packages, as described in the following section.

** Note**\
Do not confuse the lower case `-c` switch, which is short for `--depclean` (and is safe), with the upper case `-C` switch which risks damaging the system and should only be used when absolutely required (see warning below).

** Warning**\
Do **not** use the `--unmerge` (`-C`) option (unless its particular behavior is known to be specifically required). This option will remove important packages that are needed for the system to function, without warning.

#### [Cleaning out orphaned packages]

** See also**\
See [remove orphaned packages](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Knowledge_Base:Remove_orphaned_packages "Knowledge Base:Remove orphaned packages") for information on how to use [emerge \--depclean] to remove potentially unused packages. See also the [Portage FAQ](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Portage/FAQ#Why_does_emerge_--depclean_sometimes_remove_system_packages.3F "Project:Portage/FAQ").

### [Update packages]

See [Upgrading Gentoo](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Upgrading_Gentoo "Upgrading Gentoo") for instructions on how to update packages.

### [Get system information]

emerge can print system information that can be useful for troubleshooting. This information is often required to be posted when asking for [support](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Support "Support"), or when [filing a bug](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Bugzilla/Bug_report_guide "Bugzilla/Bug report guide").

`user `[`$`]`emerge --info`

Extra information may be output by using the `--verbose` flag.

## [Tips]

### [][Verifying and (re)downloading distfiles]

To re-verify the integrity of and re-download previously removed/corrupted distfiles for all currently installed packages, run:

`root `[`#`]`emerge --ask --fetchonly --emptytree @world`

### [[] Do not add dependencies to the world file]

If a dependency must be reinstalled, use the `--oneshot` (`-1`) option. Installing dependencies with the [emerge package] command would add them to the [world file](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/World_set_(Portage) "World set (Portage)") and may lead to issues.

Installing dependencies with Portage for compiling custom source software is also ill advised: it is preferable to [write an ebuild](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Basic_guide_to_write_Gentoo_Ebuilds "Basic guide to write Gentoo Ebuilds").

** See also**\
See [User:Sam/Portage help/Maintaining a Gentoo_system](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User:Sam/Portage_help/Maintaining_a_Gentoo_system#World_file_hygiene "User:Sam/Portage help/Maintaining a Gentoo system") for more information.

### [Resume emerge]

If an emerge of several packages is interrupted (e.g. ctrl+c, crash\...), the emerge may be resumed from the failed package with the `--resume` option. The `--keep-going` and `--skipfirst` options may also be of interest. See the emerge man page for details.

### [Temporary Portage configuration through environment variables defined for current invocation]

** Warning**\
Passing environment variables to [Portage](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage "Portage") on the command line will only result in **temporary** changes to system configuration, and **all such changes will be reverted** by routine maintenance, such as a [system update](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Upgrading_Gentoo "Upgrading Gentoo"). Though this section can sometimes be useful, for example to *preview* the effects of configuration changes (e.g. with the `--pretend` option), **it should not usually be used when installing or updating packages**.

\

Portage is normally configured through the [Portage configuration files](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage "/etc/portage") such as [/etc/portage/make.conf](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/make.conf "/etc/portage/make.conf"), [/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/package.accept_keywords "/etc/portage/package.accept keywords"), [/etc/portage/package.use](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/package.use "/etc/portage/package.use"), etc. - see [Portage configuration](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage#Configuration "Portage").

The emerge command can be passed temporary configuration values by declaring environment variables on the command line, in order to affect behavior for that invocation alone. For example, to merge [[[app-editors/emacs]](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/app-editors/emacs)[]] with the [[[svg]](https://packages.gentoo.org/useflags/svg)[[]](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/USE_flag "USE flag")] [USE flag](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/USE_flag "USE flag") enabled, but not make this USE flag setting permanent:

`root `[`#`]`USE='svg' emerge app-editors/emacs`

Or to pass extra configuration options to packages that use the `econf` function in their ebuild:

`root `[`#`]`EXTRA_ECONF='--without-compress-install' emerge app-editors/emacs`

** Note**\
If using [sudo](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Sudo "Sudo") to invoke emerge, environment variables may need to be set *after* the [sudo] invocation, as sudo won\'t usually preserve the environment from which it is run:

`user `[`$`]`sudo USE='svg' emerge -av app-editors/emacs`

### [re-emerging a package that provided a specific File]

Sometimes it is useful to be able to re-emerge a package simply by specifying a particular file that was provided by that package.

As an example, if the user wants to reinstall [/usr/lib/libunwind.a] but it is not known which package provided this file, the package from where that file came can be determined by [emerge] by simply indicating the file path:

`user `[`$`]`emerge -p /usr/lib/libunwind.a`

    These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

    Calculating dependencies... done!
    Dependency resolution took 2.76 s (backtrack: 0/20).

    [ebuild   R    ] sys-libs/llvm-libunwind-17.0.6

Only files that have been provided by a currently-installed package may be re-emerged in this way. See [Pfl](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Pfl "Pfl") for other ways to find what packages files might \"belong\" to.

## [Troubleshooting]

** See also**\
See [User:Sam/Portage help](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User:Sam/Portage_help "User:Sam/Portage help") for topics on Portage issues.

### [][Emerging packages fail during \'unpack\' stage]

The following message can occur when emerging packages:

     * Error messages for package dev-libs/libinput-1.16.0:
     * The ebuild phase 'unpack' has exited unexpectedly. This type of behavior
     * is known to be triggered by things such as failed variable assignments
     * (bug #190128) or bad substitution errors (bug #200313). Normally, before
     * exiting, bash should have displayed an error message above. If bash did
     * not produce an error message above, it's possible that the ebuild has
     * called `exit` when it should have called `die` instead. This behavior
     * may also be triggered by a corrupt bash binary or a hardware problem
     * such as memory or cpu malfunction. If the problem is not reproducible or
     * it appears to occur randomly, then it is likely to be triggered by a
     * hardware problem. If you suspect a hardware problem then you should try
     * some basic hardware diagnostics such as memtest. Please do not report
     * this as a bug unless it is consistently reproducible and you are sure
     * that your bash binary and hardware are functioning properly.

Although this issue may be due to the reasons listed in the output above, it can often be caused by low disk space in the path used by Portage to unpack the ebuild\'s source files. This location is set via the `PORTAGE_TMPDIR` variable and can be quickly found by querying Portage:

`user `[`$`]`portageq envvar PORTAGE_TMPDIR`

    /var/tmp

The [df](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/GNU_Coreutils#df "GNU Coreutils") command may be used to view available disk space for the partition where `PORTAGE_TMPDIR` has been mounted (this will likely be the root ([/]) partition). See [Freeing disk space](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Knowledge_Base:Freeing_disk_space "Knowledge Base:Freeing disk space") for details on how to free up disk space.
