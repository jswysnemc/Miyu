This article covers **setting up a [Raspberry Pi 4/5](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi4_64_Bit_Install "Raspberry Pi4 64 Bit Install") as a Stratum 1 Time Server**.

Any Pi will do for a Stratum 1 NTP server. A Pi4 or Pi5, that does not use USB for Ethernet, is recommended for minimal jitter. It also provides two USB3 ports that can be used for gigabit Ethernet so that routing can be added.

There is a lot of documentation on Pi stratum 1 NTP servers around the internet. Most of it applies to earlier models of the Pi, which have completely different I/O arrangements.

** Important**\
This document is for a Pi4 or Pi5

## [Motivation]

The price of electricity in the UK has gone up by a factor of four in the last six months (August, 2022).

I have been running an original Pi B with 256MB RAM (one of the first 10,000 made) as a stratum 1 NTP server, using GPS as a source of atomic time, to get to stratum 1. Just for my internal network. It was just a load and go Debian install, that I always intended to upgrade to Gentoo.

I have also been running a HP Gen 7 Microserver, hosting various KVMs. I\'m just left with my router KVM and original Pi NTP server.

By moving the Pi NTP server to a Pi4, there will be enough spare I/O bandwidth for the router too. The net result is that the Microserver can be turned off, saving about 60W on my base load, or about 1.5kW/h per day, or £22.50/month.

## [Overview]

### [Hardware Requirements]

[![](/images/thumb/5/5a/GPS_Time.jpg/300px-GPS_Time.jpg)](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/File:GPS_Time.jpg)

[](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/File:GPS_Time.jpg "Enlarge")

GPS HAT Fitted to a Pi 4

The following hardware is required to follow on with this article:

-   A Pi 4 or Pi5 \-- this article was based on a repurposed 4GB Pi 4.
-   A GPS Time HAT with the PPS on GPIO 18. Do fit the battery to keep the clock alive.

That it\'s a GPS Time HAT with the PPS on GPIO 18 matters.

The image shows a GPS HAT, designed for a Pi 1, fitted to a Pi 4 - hence the additional GPI0 Pins.

** Note**\
The Pi 4 has Wifi but the aluminium case illustrated is an excellent Faraday cage, so the Wifi cannot be used

### [Software Requirements]

The following packages are required:

-   [[[net-misc/ntp]](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/net-misc/ntp)[]]
-   [[[sci-geosciences/gpsd]](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sci-geosciences/gpsd)[]]

A Pi should already have [[[net-misc/ntp]](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/net-misc/ntp)[]], as its missing an RTC but it will need to be configured as a server for the local network and to use localhost as a source of time.

[[[sci-geosciences/gpsd]](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sci-geosciences/gpsd)[]] takes care of the gps side of things.

### [Installation Site]

The GPS antenna needs a clear view of sky towards the equator from it\'s position. It may not work indoors, even behind windows that are coated to retain/reflect heat as these coatings can reflect/block the GPS radio signal.

### [How It Works]

GPS works by solving four simultaneous equations, to derive Latitude, Longitude, Altitude and Time from at least four satellites. Modules that only care about time assume that they are at a fixed location and average out Latitude, Longitude and Altitude changes, which produces a better quality of time.

There are actually two solutions to the simultaneous equations, given only four satellites. One close to the earth, one thousands of miles away in space. The latter is discarded.

PPS on GPIO 18 is the default in the Pi pps-gpio overlay. If the GPS HAT uses a different GPIO pin, a parameter must be passed to `dtoverlay=pps-gpio` in [/boot/config.txt].

The PPS produces an interrupt, which is the boundary between seconds. It says nothing about which seconds the boundary is between.

Time is read from the GPS module over the serial port. That will be [/dev/ttyS0].

## [Setting Up]

Carry out a basic install. Follow the [Raspberry Pi Install Guide](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_Install_Guide "Raspberry Pi Install Guide"). Use the `default/linux/arm64/23.0` profile as the NTP server will be headless.

Using the mainline kernel should work but old habits die hard.

As the mini-UART will be used, Wifi and Bluetooth can work, but are not included here. Bluetooth is connected to the PL011 main UART. Wifi uses the second SDIO interface.

### [][net-misc/ntp]

At the time of writing, [[[parse-clocks]](https://packages.gentoo.org/useflags/parse-clocks)[[]](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/USE_flag "USE flag")] is masked on [[[net-misc/ntp]](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/net-misc/ntp)[]] for arm64. The mask is over 10 years old and it appears to work for some. Meanwhile, add an entry to [/etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask/ntp] that reads `net-misc/ntp -parse-clocks`.

**TODO:**

[ **Todo:**]

-   After further testing, fix the ::gentoo repo.

\

Build [[[net-misc/ntp]](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/net-misc/ntp)[]] with `USE="caps ipv6 parse-clocks readline ssl threads"`.

[[[parse-clocks]](https://packages.gentoo.org/useflags/parse-clocks)[[]](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/USE_flag "USE flag")] adds PPS support, which is fairly essential.

### [][sci-geosciences/gpsd]

[[[sci-geosciences/gpsd]](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sci-geosciences/gpsd)[]] needs `USE="cxx ipv6 ncurses ntp python shm sockets"` and support for the protocol used by the GPS module.

All are built by default. `GPSD_PROTOCOLS="+aivdm +ashtech +earthmate +evermore +fury +fv18 +garmin +garmintxt +geostar +gpsclock +greis +isync +itrax +mtk3301 +navcom +nmea0183 +nmea2000 +ntrip +oceanserver +oncore +passthrough +rtcm104v2 +rtcm104v3 +sirf +skytraq +superstar2 +tnt +tripmate +tsip +ublox"`

Set `GPSD_PROTOCOLS` in make.conf according to taste.

gpsmon reports the protocol is use. Such as:

`root `[`#`]`gpsmon`

    tcp://localhost:2947          NMEA0183>

### [Kernel Options]

For Pi4 `make bcm2711_defconfig` and for a Pi5 `make bcm2712_defconfig`should just work. It has `PPS_GPIO` and `8250_SERIAL` support available. The former is for our PPS interrupt and the latter is for the mini-UART.

It\'s full of things not needed, so feel free to slim it down.

A Pi 4 takes about an hour to build a bcm2711_defconfig kernel for itself, so cross compiling is not the essential that it once was.

## [Putting the Pieces Together.]

Now all the bits are ready, it\'s time to set up the configuration files and start services.

### [][/boot/config.txt]

In addition to everything else, [/boot/config.txt] requires:

[FILE] **`/boot/config.txt`**

    # GPS Time
    # For GPS 1 PPS
    enable_uart=1
    dtoverlay=pps-gpio

Adding a non default GPIO pin here is left as an exercise for the reader.

This loads the pps-gpio overlay, which sets up GPIO 18 as an input and attaches it to an IRQ. /proc/interrupts will include something like:

`root `[`#`]`cat /proc/interrupts`

               CPU0       CPU1       CPU2       CPU3
     49:      90274          0          0          0  pinctrl-bcm2835  18 Edge      pps@12.-1

### [][/boot/cmdline.txt]

First and foremost, [/boot/cmdline.txt] must be a single line.

It needs to include `8250.nr_uarts=1` to enable the mini-UART.

The default `8250.nr_uarts=0` disables the mini-UART so no serial data will be shown.

### [][/etc/conf.d/gpsd]

The non comment lines in [/etc/conf.d/gpsd] need to read:

[FILE] **`/etc/conf.d/gpsd`**

    GPSD_OPTIONS="-n"

    # Uncomment one of DEVICES= lines below
    # Use the mini UART on Raspberry Pis before the Pi5
    #DEVICES="/dev/ttyS0"
    # The Pi5 does not have a mini UART. Use the primary UART
    # Console output goes to the debug port, which is /dev/ttyAMA10
    #DEVICES="/dev/ttyAMA0"

    GPSD_SOCKET="/run/gpsd.sock"

** Note**\
Non Pi4 documents will cite [/dev/ttyAMA0] as the DEVICE.

### [][/etc/ntp.conf]

[/etc/ntp.conf] needs some changes.

The first change allows all of 192.168.0.0/16 to get time from the NTP server. If the LAN uses a different private network range, change the restrict statement:

[FILE] **`/etc/ntp.conf`**

    # Let all the LAN get time
    restrict 192.168.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0 nomodify nopeer notrap

Tell ntpd to use the PPS:

[FILE] **`/etc/ntp.conf`**

    # pps-gpio on /dev/pps0
    server 127.127.22.0 minpoll 4 maxpoll 4
    fudge 127.127.22.0 refid PPS
    fudge 127.127.22.0 flag3 1  # enable kernel PLL/FLL clock discipline

And the Shared Memory Clock:

[FILE] **`/etc/ntp.conf`**

    # gpsd shared memory clock
    server 127.127.28.0 minpoll 4 maxpoll 4 prefer  # PPS requires at least one preferred peer
    fudge 127.127.28.0 refid GPS
    fudge 127.127.28.0 time1 +0.130  # coarse processing delay offset

Find a local NTP pool to use, rather then the Gentoo pools. For example, for a UK pool:

[FILE] **`/etc/ntp.conf`**

    # a UK based pool
    pool uk.pool.ntp.org minpoll 10 iburst

### [rc-update]

Add both `ntpd` and `gpsd` to the default runlevel, then reboot to test.

## [Powering Up The First Time]

Acquiring the first satellite can take from minutes to hours. However, all satellites transmit the ephemeris, which tells the receiver where all the other satellites are. Once the receiver has the time and ephemeris, the battery makes resuming operation after a power loss fairly quick.

There are GPS receivers that have a PPS LED, which flashes once satellites have been acquired. Interestingly, in one test, the receiver will not acquire the first satellite behind thermal glass but does maintain lock once it has the ephemeris.

## [Testing the NTP Server]

Look at the output of [uname -a] and check that the date and time correspond to the date and time of the kernel build.

In the example, the position, accurate to a few meters, has been redacted:

`root `[`#`]`gpsmon`

As all the satellites are all located above the receiver, altitude is very poor.

Notice the `sync_pps` and `stratum=1` below:

The microsecond values of jitter and wander are encouraging too:

Offset and jitter are in milliseconds. Values of a few microseconds can be expected given a few days operation.

## [Client Configuration]

Its all very well having a local working stratum 1 NTP server on your network. Tell your clients all about it or it will not be used.

The default gentoo [/etc/ntp.conf] needs a one line addition

[FILE] **`/etc/ntp.conf`**

    # Pi4 Router/Time Server
    server 192.168.100.252 prefer iburst

This allows the four gentoo.pool.ntp.org entries to remain as fallbacks.

Restart the ntpd service.
