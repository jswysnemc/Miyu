      pasuspender  is a tool that can be used to tell a
    local PulseAudio sound server to temporarily suspend access to the
    audio devices, to allow other
    applications access them directly.  pasuspender  will
    suspend access to the audio devices, fork a child process, and
    when the child process terminates, resume access again.

     Make sure to include  --  in
    your  pasuspender  command line before passing the
    subprocess command line (as shown
    above). Otherwise  pasuspender  itself might end up
    interpreting the command line switches and options you intended to
    pass to the subprocess.
