# Gamepad

Many gamepads are working out-of-the-box nowadays, but there are still many potential problems and sources for errors since gamepad support in applications varies by a lot.

Linux has two different input systems for gamepads – the original Joystick interface and the newer evdev-based interface.

 maps to the Joystick API interface and  maps to the evdev ones (this also includes other input devices such as mice and keyboards). Symbolic links to those devices are also available in  and  where the legacy Joystick API has names ending with  while the evdev have names ending with .

Most new games will default to the evdev interface as it gives more detailed information about the buttons and axes available and also adds support for force feedback.

Many applications use SDL to access gamepads.
* SDL1 defaults to the evdev interface, but it can be forced to use Joystick by setting the environment variable .
* SDL2 and SDL3 default to using hidapi on the most popular controllers in order to get raw access. On other controllers, or if hidapi is disabled, they use evdev instead.

SDL itself offers different APIs, the selection of which depends on the application. Their usage is not mutually exclusive.
*  is supported in all versions and maps the evdev (or Joystick) events 1:1 with SDL's own.
* , supported on SDL2, offers standardardized mapping between devices. For a controller to be supported, it needs an evdev:SDL mapping in a database, . This API is replaced with  in SDL3.

## Installation
Unless you are using very old joystick that uses Gameport or a proprietary USB protocol, you will need just the generic USB Human Interface Device (HID) modules.

For an extensive overview of all joystick related modules in Linux, you can browse a local copy in  if you have installed the  package. Alternatively, see documentation from the latest kernel.

Some joysticks need specific modules, such as the Microsoft Sidewinder controllers (), or the Logitech digital controllers (). Many older joysticks will work with the simple  module. If your joystick is plugging in to a gameport provided by your soundcard, you will need your soundcard drivers loaded — however, some cards, like the Soundblaster Live, have a specific gameport driver (). Older ISA soundcards may need the  module, which is a standard gameport module.

As you can see, there are many different modules related to getting your joystick working in Linux, so everything is not covered here. Please have a look at the documentation mentioned above for details.

## Loading the modules for analogue devices
You need to load a module for your gameport (, , , etc...), a module for your joystick (, , , etc...), and finally the kernel joystick device driver (). You can load the module at boot, or simply modprobe it. The  module should load automatically, as this is a dependency of the other modules.

## USB gamepads
You need to get USB working, and then modprobe your gamepad driver, which is , as well as .
If you use a usb mouse or keyboard,  will be loaded already and you just have to load the  module.

## Configuration
## Testing
Once the modules are loaded, you should be able to find a new device:  and a file ending with  in  directory. You can simply  those devices to see if the joystick works — move the stick around, press all the buttons - you should see mojibake printed when you move the sticks or press buttons.

If you get a permission error, see #Device permissions.

If you are not able to find the aforementioned input devices for your gamepad, you might try to force USBHID driver to handle the gamepad with the following command (where  and  are the vendor ID and product ID of your gamepad retrievable using lsusb from ). Make sure to physically reconnect your device after running this command.

 # printf VID PID > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usbhid/new_id

Wine uses SDL for both DirectInput and XInput emulation, with evdev as a fallback. You can test them with . For PlayStation 4 and 5 controllers, see #Using with Wine.

## Joystick API
There are a lot of applications that can test this old API,  from the  package is the simplest one. If the output is unreadable because the line printed is too long you can also use graphical tools. KDE Plasma has a built in one in System Settings > Input Devices > Game Controller. There is  as an alternative.

Use of  is fairly simple, you just run  and it will print a line with state of all the axes (normalised to {{ic|{-32767,32767}}}) and buttons.

After you start , it will just show you a list of joysticks available, you just need to select one and press Properties.

## evdev API
The 'evdev' API can be tested using  from  or  from .

To test force feedback on the device, use  from :

 $ fftest /dev/input/by-id/usb-*event-joystick

## SDL APIs
Install . If more than one controller is connected, use  to get their ID.

To test the  API on device index 0:

 $ sdl2-jstest --test 0

To test the  API instead:

 $ sdl2-jstest --gamecontroller 0

## HTML5 Gamepad API
Go to https://gamepad-tester.com/. Currently, testing vibration and producing a visual of the gamepad is supported in Chromium but not Firefox. Additionally, as of version 107.0.5304.121-1, Chromium can read Joystick devices but not evdev.

## Setting up deadzones and calibration
If you want to set up the deadzones (or remove them completely) of your analog input you have to do it separately for the xorg (for mouse and keyboard emulation), Joystick API and evdev API.

## Wine deadzones
Add the following registry entry and set it to a string from  to  (affects all axes):

 HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wine\DirectInput\DefaultDeadZone

See Useful Registry Keys.

## Xorg deadzones
Add a similar line to  (create if it does not exist):

 is the default value, but you can set anything between  and . To get the axis number see the "Testing Your Configuration" section of this article.
If you already have an option with a specific axis just type in the  at the end of the parameter separated by a space.

## Joystick API deadzones and calibration
The easiest way is using jstest-gtk from . Select the joystick you want to edit, click the Properties button. On this new window, click the Calibration button (do not click Start Calibration after that). You can then set the  and  values, which control the center deadzone, and  and , which control the end of throw deadzones. Note that the calibration settings are applied when the application opens the device, so you need to restart your game or test application to see updated calibration settings.

After you set the deadzones, you also can create an udev rule to make all changes permanent:

First, grab the vendor id of your joystick (replace  with your joystick's number, it is usually ):

 $ udevadm info -q property --property ID_VENDOR_ID --value /dev/input/jsX

Also grab the model id:

 $ udevadm info -q property --property ID_MODEL_ID --value /dev/input/jsX

If the commands above give you an empty output, it could be because your controller is connected via Bluetooth, making these unique attributes only visible on the parent device(s). To mitigate this, you could try finding other unique attributes by running:

 $ udevadm info -a /dev/input/jsX

This will list all available attributes from your device (and parent devices). So, for example, if the parent device of your joystick has the attribute {{ic|1=ATTRS{uniq}=="a0:b1:c2:d3:e4:f5"}}, or maybe both {{ic|1=ATTRS{idVendor}=="054c"}} and {{ic|1=ATTRS{idProduct}=="09cc"}}, then you can use these instead of {{ic|ENV{ID_VENDOR_ID} }} and {{ic|ENV{ID_MODEL_ID} }} in the udev rule below.

You can also have both rules at the same time, just separate them with a new line.

Anyway, now use jscal to dump the new calibration settings of your joystick:

 $ jscal -p /dev/input/jsX

Now, modify this udev rule with the values you got:

{{hc|1=/etc/udev/rules.d/85-jscal-custom-calibration.rules|2=
ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="jsENV{ID_VENDOR_ID}=="054c", ENV{ID_MODEL_ID}=="09cc", RUN+="/usr/bin/jscal -s 1,1,1,1 /dev/input/js%n"
}}

This rule will automatically run  whenever you connect a joystick with vendor id  and model id . The  part is required to automatically determine the correct joystick, so do not remove it.

Finally, load this new udev rule.

## evdev API deadzones and calibration
The evdev-joystick tool from the  package can be used to view and change deadzones and calibration for  API devices.

To view your device configuration:

 $ evdev-joystick --showcal /dev/input/by-id/usb-*-event-joystick

To change the deadzone for a particular axis, use a command like:

 $ evdev-joystick --evdev /dev/input/by-id/usb-*-event-joystick --axis 0 --deadzone 0

To set the same deadzone for all axes at once, omit the  option.

Use udev rules file to set them automatically when the controller is connected.

Note that inside the kernel, the value is called  and is set using the  .

Default configuration will look like similar to this:

While a more reasonable setting would be achieved with something like this (repeat for other axes):

## xboxdrv deadzones and calibration
Example command for creating a virtual Xbox 360 controller, with the  axis set with deadzone , minimum readable value , center , and maximum .

 # xboxdrv --deadzone 4000 --calibration Y1=-32768:128:29000

See  for more options.

## Disable joystick from controlling mouse
If you want to play games with your gamepad, you might want to disable its joystick control over mouse cursor.

The simplest way is to disable the mouse device in the desktop environment settings. Otherwise, edit  (create if it does not exists) so that it looks like this:

## Using gamepad to send keystrokes
Some of the generic input remap utilities, such as Input Remapper, work for mapping gamepad buttons to keyboard keys. Gamepad-specific tools for this include:

*
*
*
*  - see Steam#Steam Input

All work well without the need for additional X.org configuration.

## Xorg configuration example
This is a good solution for systems where restarting Xorg is a rare event because it is a static configuration loaded only on X startup. The example runs on a Kodi media PC, controlled with a Logitech Cordless RumblePad 2. Due to a problem with the d-pad (a.k.a. "hat") being recognized as another axis, Joy2key was used as a workaround. Since  version 11.0 and  1.6.3-1, this setup no longer worked and the following was created for letting Xorg handle joystick events.

First, install the  package. Then, create an X configuration file:

## Remapping of gamepad buttons and more
With some programs you can also configure your gamepad further, including the following potential features:

* Remapping buttons and axes.
** Assigning mapping profiles to different games.
* Emulating a different type of gamepad. Some software can often behave better when given an Xbox 360 Controller, as this is a very common controller that many games have been tested with.
* Additional functionality such as Macros, On-Screen-Displays etc.

List of software:

*
*
*

## Remapping of gamepad on SDL2 applications
Gamepads can be remapped for SDL2 applications using the  environment variable. For each line, it includes the gamepad's GUID, a name, button / axis mappings and a platform. The controller's GUID can be retrieved by installing  and then running .

For example, to map Microsoft Xbox 360 controllers with different GUIDs:

Some apps extract mapping information from a  file. It can be edited graphically with . An up to date database can be found on [https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB.

## Mimic Xbox 360 controller
#xboxdrv can be used to make any controller register as an Xbox 360 controller with the  switch. This may be desirable for games that support Xbox 360 controllers out of the box, but have trouble detecting or working with other gamepads.

You can mimic an Xbox 360 controller with the following command:

 $ xboxdrv --evdev /dev/input/event* --evdev-absmap ABS_RX=X2 --evdev-keymap BTN_THUMB2=a,BTN_THUMB=b,BTN_PINKIE=rt --mimic-xpad

The above example is incomplete. It only maps one axis and 3 buttons for demonstration purposes. Use  to see the names of the Xbox controller buttons and axes and bind them accordingly by expanding the command above. Axes mappings should go after  and button mappings follow  (comma separated list; no spaces).

By default,  outputs all events to the terminal. You can use this to test that the mappings are correct. Append the  option to keep it quiet.

## Specific devices
While most gamepads, especially USB based ones should just work, some may require (or give better results) if you use alternative drivers.

## Dance pads
Most dance pads should work. However some pads, especially those used from a video game console via an adapter, have a tendency to map the directional buttons as axis buttons. This prevents hitting left-right or up-down simultaneously. This behavior can be fixed for devices recognized by xpad via a module option:

 # modprobe -r xpad
 # modprobe xpad dpad_to_buttons=1

If that did not work, you can try  or patching the  kernel module (https://github.com/adiel-mittmann/dancepad).

## Logitech Thunderpad Digital
Logitech Thunderpad Digital will not show all the buttons if you use the  module. Use the device specific  module for this controller.

## Nintendo Gamecube Controller
Dolphin Emulator has a page on their wiki that explains how to use the official Nintendo USB adapter with a GameCube controller. This configuration also works with the Mayflash Controller Adapter if the switch is set to "Wii U".

Steam Input supports the GameCube adapter, but it is not enabled by default since opening it is exclusive with other applications. To enable it anyway, launch Steam with the command line option .For other applications, you can use .

## Nintendo Switch Pro Controller and Joy-Cons
These controllers are supported since kernel version 5.16. The Switch Online NES, SNES and N64 controllers are also supported since kernel version 6.12.

## Userspace daemon
 is a userspace daemon that provides better integration for Nintendo Switch Controllers. When the daemon is active, Switch controllers placed in a pairing mode (LEDs flashing) can have both their triggers pressed to be paired, and then ready to be used by apps. See [https://github.com/DanielOgorchock/joycond?tab=readme-ov-file#usage.

## Use Joy-Cons as one device
The  kernel driver handles two Joy-Cons as two separate devices.

To pair two Joy-Cons together, make sure  is running and both Joy-Cons are in pairing mode. Then, press one trigger on each Joy-Con at the same time.

## Use positional layout on SDL2 applications
By default, SDL2 maps buttons on Nintendo controllers according to the gamepad's label instead of the button's position. This causes the mapping of the buttons A/B and X/Y to be swapped compared to other controllers. If this is undesirable, set the environment variable .

Starting from SDL3, mapping is always positional.Note that  preserves the old behavior.[https://github.com/libsdl-org/sdl2-compat/blob/ed7e8bd5b169f379d7b1ba57b242657bc3455ebb/src/sdl2_compat.c#L2020-L2024

## Steam Controller (2015)
The Steam client will recognize the controller and provide keyboard/mouse/gamepad emulation while Steam is running. The in-game Steam overlay needs to be enabled and working in order for gamepad emulation to work. You may need to run  with root privileges or plug the dongle out and in again, if the controller does not work immediately after installing and running Steam. If all else fails, try restarting the computer while the dongle is plugged in.

If you are using the controller connected via Bluetooth LE, make sure the user is part of the  group.

If you cannot get the Steam Controller to work, see #Steam Controller not pairing or recognized in games (including USB).

## Basic functionality without Steam
Install the  or  package to get the required udev rules for this controller.

This seems sufficient for the mouse functionality described above to work when not running a game, and for example some SDL-based games (like Stardew Valley) let you play with with the controller. The functionality will be limited compared to what Steam provides.

## Xbox 360 controller
Both the wired and wireless (with the Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver for Windows) controllers are supported by the  kernel module and should work without additional packages. Note that using a wireless Xbox 360 controller with the Play&Charge USB cable will not work. The cable is for recharging only and does not transmit any input data over the wire.

It has been reported that the default xpad driver has some issues with a few newer wired and wireless controllers, such as:
* incorrect button mapping. (discussion in Steam bugtracker)
* not-working sync. (discussion in Arch Forum)
* all four LEDs keep blinking, but controller works. TLP's USB autosuspend is one sure cause of this issue with wireless controllers. See below for fix.

If you use the TLP power management tool, you may experience connection issues with your Microsoft wireless adapter (e.g. the indicator LED will go out after the adapter has been connected for a few seconds, and controller connection attempts fail, four LEDs keep blinking but controller works). This is due to TLP's USB autosuspend functionality, and the solution is to add the Microsoft wireless adapter's device ID to TLP blacklist
(to check device ID to blacklist, run ; for original MS wireless dongle just add  to ),
check TLP configuration for more details.

If you experience such issues, you can use #xboxdrv as the default  driver instead.

In order to connect via Bluetooth, add the following kernel parameter .

If you experience problems with the rumble feature not working in games, it may be necessary to set the environment variable .

## xboxdrv
xboxdrv is an alternative to  which provides more functionality and might work better with certain controllers. It works in userspace and can be launched as system service.

Install it with the  package. Then start/enable .

If you have issues with the controller being recognized but not working in steam games or working but with incorrect mappings, it may be required to modify you configuration as such:

Then restart .

## Multiple controllers
xboxdrv supports a multitude of controllers, but they need to be set up in . For each extra controller, add an  line. For example, when using 4 controllers, add it 3 times:

Then restart .

## Using generic/clone controllers
Some clone gamepads might require a specific initialization sequence in order to work (Super User answer). For that you should run the following python script as the root user:

## Xbox Wireless Controller / Xbox One Wireless Controller
## Connect Xbox Wireless Controller with USB cable
This is supported by the kernel and works without any additional packages.

## Connect Xbox Wireless Controller with Bluetooth
## Update controller firmware via Windows 10
The firmware of the Xbox Wireless Controller used to cause loops of connecting/disconnecting with Bluez. The best workaround is to plug the controller (via a USB cord) to a Windows 10 computer, download the Xbox Accessories application through the Microsoft Store, and update the firmware of the controller.

## xpadneo
A relatively new driver which does support the Xbox One S and Xbox Series X|S controller via Bluetooth is called xpadneo. In addition to these two models, it has also basic support for the Xbox Elite Series 2 Wireless controller. In exchange for fully supporting just two controllers so far, it enables one to read out the correct battery level, supports rumble (even the one on the trigger buttons - L2/R2), corrects the (sometimes wrong) button mapping and more.

Installation is done using DKMS: .

## Connect Xbox Wireless Controller with Microsoft Xbox Wireless Adapter
xone is a Linux kernel driver for Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S accessories. It serves as a modern replacement for and supersedes xpad and xow. Currently working via wired or with the Microsoft Xbox Wireless Adapter "dongle". Bugfixes for this driver are now being mainted by the dlundqvist fork of the original driver.

Install  and, if using the wireless dongle, . Installation requires a reboot of your system.

## Controller performs poorly (low polling rate) after being paired
You will need to update the controller's firmware in Windows using the "Xbox Accessories" app from the Microsoft Store. Theoretically this should be possible with USB passthrough to a Windows virtual machine, but you may need to dual boot to an actual (baremetal) Windows installation for the Xbox Accessories application to see the controller and do the firmware update.

## Dual boot with Windows
Pairing the controller & adapter in Windows may cause the pairing to be lost in Linux. You will need to re-pair the controller & dongle when you reboot into Linux. This also happens in the other direction — when the controller & dongle are paired in Linux, they will need to be re-paired the next time you want to use them in Windows. This can be avoided by following the instructions for dual boot pairing.

## Failure to connect after Suspend and wake on gamepad use.
On some platforms, supending can cause the device to enter a state where it does not respond properly. As the device is recognised by Linux as a bluetooth adapter, it is automatically put into power-off state on suspend, which also disables waking the system from the gamepad. This can be mitigated by use of  on the kernel command line. Note: This will disable power suspend on all other USB Bluetooth adapters on the system.

## PlayStation 3 controller
## Pairing via USB
If you own a PS3 controller and can connect with USB, plug it to your computer and press the PS button. The controller will power up and one of the four LEDs should light up indicating the controller's number.

## Pairing via Bluetooth
Install  and . Make sure bluetooth is working by following the first five steps of Bluetooth#Pairing and leave the bluetoothctl command running, then turn on the controller by pressing the middle 'PS' button(all 4 leds should be blinking quickly ~4 hz) and connect to your computer using usb. Lastly, type yes in the bluetoothctl prompt when asked ''.

## PlayStation 3/4 controller
The DualShock 3, DualShock 4 and Sixaxis controllers work out of the box when plugged in via USB (the PS button will need to be pushed to begin). They can also be used wirelessly via Bluetooth.

Steam properly recognizes it as a PS3 pad and Big Picture can be launched with the PS button. Big Picture and some games may act as if it was a 360 controller. Gamepad control over mouse is on by default. You may want to turn it off before playing games, see #Disable joystick from controlling mouse.

## Pairing via Bluetooth
Install the  and  packages, which includes the sixaxis plugin. Then start the bluetooth service and ensure bluetooth is powered on. If using bluetoothctl start it in a terminal and then plug the controller in via USB. You should be prompted to trust the controller in bluetoothctl. A graphical bluetooth front-end may program your PC's bluetooth address into the controller automatically. Hit the PlayStation button and check that the controller works while plugged in.

You can now disconnect your controller. The next time you hit the PlayStation button it will connect without asking anything else.

Alternatively, on a PS4 controller you can hold the share button and the PlayStation button simultaneously (for a few seconds) to put the gamepad in pairing mode, and pair as you would normally.

GNOME's Settings also provides a graphical interface to pair sixaxis controllers when connected by wire.

Remember to disconnect the controller when you are done as the controller will stay on when connected and drain the battery.

## Using generic/clone controllers
Using generic/clone Dualshock controllers is possible, however there is an issue that may require to install a patched package. The default Bluetooth protocol stack does not detect some of the clone controllers. The  package is a version patched to be able to detect them.
 is another package that only patch the bluez-plugins may work for some controllers.

## PlayStation 4/5 controller
## Pairing via USB
Connect your controller via USB and press the  button.

## Pairing via Bluetooth
If you want to use Bluetooth mode, hold down the  button and  button together. The white LED of the controller should blink very quickly, and the wireless controller can be paired with your Bluetooth manager.

## Using with Wine
On these controllers, Wine uses hidraw by default (since 8.0), so that Windows applications that support them can use all of their features. Due to this Windows-like behavior, they are not exposed as XInput devices, which prevents them from working in many applications.

To disable this behavior, import the following text file into the Wine registry with regedit:

 Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
 "DisableHidraw"=dword:1

Since Wine 9.18, this setting can be controlled from .

## Disable touchpad acting as mouse
If using libinput with Xorg, or if using Wayland, then you can follow Libinput#Using environment variable to disable the touchpad device.

Note that, since the touchpad is just one part of the controller, selecting the input device by vendor and product IDs will not suffice. Instead, consider selecting the device by name.

For a full set of attributes you can use, consult , where  is the path to the device, such as  or .

To find the device path, you can use a tool such as [https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=evtest evtest by just running . This command should also print out the name of the device.

Example snippet:

{{hc|/etc/udev/rules.d/72-ds4tm.rules|2=
# Disable DS4 touchpad acting as mouse
# USB
ATTRS{name}=="Sony Interactive Entertainment Wireless Controller Touchpad", ENV{LIBINPUT_IGNORE_DEVICE}="1"
# Bluetooth
ATTRS{name}=="Wireless Controller Touchpad", ENV{LIBINPUT_IGNORE_DEVICE}="1"
}}

With DualSense controllers, replace the names with  and .

Then, reload udev rules. Reconnect the gamepad to apply changes.

## dualsensectl
dualsensectl is a tool that can toggle the lightbar and microphone (and its LED), monitor the battery status, and power off the controller. To use it, install .

## Tips and tricks
## Gamepad over network
If you want to use your gamepad with another computer over a network, you can use USB/IP or  to do this.

## Measure controller polling rates and latencies via gamepadla-polling
See also: Mouse polling rate

Gamepadla hosts a crowdsourced database for controller-specific latency, and polling data.The tool for making these reports reads evdev/hidraw events via pygame/SDL and it can be obtained from .

## Overclock controller polling rates via usb_oc-dkms
 can be used to override bInterval on controller's USB device endpoints, effectively overclocking their polling rates, if the device will allow itself to be polled at a higher rate and give the host more data.

Most notably popular devices like Sony DualSense can be overclocked (from 250 Hz to 1000 Hz, or partially to 8000 Hz).

## Troubleshooting
## Device permissions
Gamepad devices are affected by udev rules: unless they grant access to the device, it simply will not be readable by users. This section investigates the possibility of you already having a configuration file handling this.

Any gamepad device, regardless of whether it is over USB or Bluetooth, is handled by the [https://docs.kernel.org/input/input_uapi.html "input" subsystem of the kernel, corresponding with . It is also common for udev rules to target the "hidraw" kernel module. Combining these, we can understand udev's handling of these devices by inspecting the configuration shipped by packages:

 $ grep --extended-regexp 'SUBSYSTEM=="input"|KERNEL=="hidraw' --recursive /usr/lib/udev/rules.d

Some examples of applications which ship noteworthy rules:

* systemd's default rules set the group of all  devices to , and the mode of joystick devices to  * Steam ships udev rules allowing access to a variety of controllers. See [https://steamcommunity.com/app/353370/discussions/2/1735465524711324558/ this Steam discussion for further info about the contents of the rules.
* Dolphin emulator ships udev rules allowing access to controllers it supports.

If your system does not already happen to have a udev rule for the device you want to use, you can either write one yourself or install the  package and restart your computer.

## Gamepad is not recognized by all programs
Some software, Steam for example, will only recognize the first gamepad it encounters. Due to a bug in the driver for Microsoft wireless periphery devices this can in fact be the bluetooth dongle. If you find you have a  and  belonging to you keyboard's bluetooth transceiver you can get automatically get rid of it by creating according udev rules:

{{hc|/etc/udev/rules.d/99-btcleanup.rules|2=
ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="jsSUBSYSTEM=="input", KERNELS=="...", ATTRS{bInterfaceSubClass}=="00", ATTRS{bInterfaceProtocol}=="00", ATTRS{bInterfaceNumber}=="02", RUN+="/usr/bin/rm /dev/input/js%n"
ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="event*", SUBSYSTEM=="input", KERNELS=="...", ATTRS{bInterfaceSubClass}=="00", ATTRS{bInterfaceProtocol}=="00", ATTRS{bInterfaceNumber}=="02", RUN+="/usr/bin/rm /dev/input/event%n"
}}

Correct the  to match your device. The correct value can be found by running

 # udevadm info -an /dev/input/js0

Assuming the device in question is . After you placed the rule reload the rules with

 # udevadm control --reload

Then replug the device making you trouble. The joystick and event devices should be gone, although their number will still be reserved. But the files are out of the way.

## Application only supports Xbox 360 controllers
Some Windows games look for an Xbox 360 controller in particular, missing functionality (like vibration) or not working at all otherwise.

For a workaround, see #Mimic Xbox 360 controller.

## Nintendo Switch Pro Controller disconnects when using Bluetooth
The Nintendo Switch Pro Controller and variants may disconnect when receiving rumble inputs.

This can be worked around by changing the name of the Bluetooth adapter to "Nintendo".[https://github.com/DanielOgorchock/linux/issues/33#issuecomment-2790843365

## Steam Controller
## Steam Controller not pairing or recognized in games (including USB)
There are some unknown cases where the packaged udev rule for the Steam controller does not work (). This can result in many issues, such as the Steam Controller behaving functionally in the desktop and in Steam, but failing to have any effect in games (including over USB controller connections).  The most reliable workaround is to make the controller world readable. Copy the rule  to  with a later priority and change anything that says  to  e.g.

{{hc|/etc/udev/rules.d/99-steam-controller-perms.rules|2=
...
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="28de", MODE="0666"
...
}}

You may have to reboot in order for the change to take effect.

## Steam Controller makes a game crash or not recognized
If your Steam Controller is working well in Steam Big Picture mode, but not recognized by a game or the game starts crashing when you plug in the controller, this may be because of the native driver that has been added to the Linux kernel 4.18. Try to unload it, restart Steam and replug the controller.

The module name of the driver is , so to unload it you may perform:

 # rmmod hid_steam

If this module is not already loaded but the controller is still not recognized by games, refer to the previous section's udev rule solution in #Steam Controller not pairing or recognized in games (including USB).

## Xbox One Wireless Gamepad detected but no inputs recognized
This can occur when using a third party Xbox One controller with the  or #xboxdrv drivers. Try switching to #xpadneo.

## PlayStation 4 Controllers
## Controller not recognized when using Bluetooth
Install the  package and run it with the hidraw () backend parameter.

## Motion controls taking over joypad controls and/or causing unintended input with joypad controls
With certain cloud gaming applications such as Parsec and Shadow, the Dualshock 4 V1 and V2 motion controls can conflict with the joypad controls resulting in the joypad not working, and with certain input sensitive games, especially racing games, the motion controls can cause unintentional drift during joypad control gameplay.

This can be worked around by disabling the motion controls and the touchpad by adding the following udev rules:

{{hc|1=/etc/udev/rules.d/51-disable-DS3-and-DS4-motion-controls.rules|2=
SUBSYSTEM=="input", ATTRS{name}=="*Controller Motion Sensors", RUN+="/bin/rm %E{DEVNAME}", ENV{ID_INPUT_JOYSTICK}=""
SUBSYSTEM=="input", ATTRS{name}=="*Controller Touchpad", RUN+="/bin/rm %E{DEVNAME}", ENV{ID_INPUT_JOYSTICK}=""
}}

Then reload the rules or reboot: these rules should work in both USB and Bluetooth mode.

## Multi-mode wired gamepads
Some gamepads have 3 modes when wired: Switch, Xbox 360/Windows, Android.

And they also do not have hotkeys to switch between them when connected wired.

## ZD O+ Excellence
The gamepad defaults to Switch mode and falls back to XInput. The gamepad inputs are not handled properly in this mode. The rest of the rebinds you can make, e.g. keyboard and mouse inputs all seem to work properly in XInput mode by default.

## DirectInput
This can be fixed by switching to DirectInput mode every time you use it, but that is annoying and does not work for some HTML5 games.

## udev
Add the following udev rule and it will be handled as an Xbox 360 controller using xpad:

{{hc|/etc/udev/rules.d/99-zdO-xinput.rules|2=
ACTION=="add", ATTRS{idVendor}=="11c0", ATTRS{idProduct}=="5505", RUN+="/sbin/modprobe xpad", RUN+="/bin/sh -c 'echo 11c0 5505 > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/xpad/new_id'"
}}

Reload your udev rules.

Then replug your gamepad.

## ShanWan
When you connect this gamepad to Windows, it is in Xbox 360 Controller mode.

But when you connect such gamepad to Linux, it enters the fallback mode (which happens to be the Android mode), which has a worse polling rate (100 Hz), the Home button acting as ; doesn't expose vibration, gyroscope, and accelerometer; doesn't support xboxdrv without ; and identifies itself as e.g. "SHANWAN Android Gamepad" which is not liked by some games (though for SDL2 apps you can set a name in ).

When you connect the gamepad, it first tries to be a "Switch Pro Controller", but for some reason the Linux kernel considers the descriptors (sent by the gamepad) invalid, and therefore disconnects the gamepad. This causes the gamepad to reconnect in the aforementioned fallback mode.

In  this looks like:

Notice that the "USB Device number" gets increased after the failure. For some USB hubs the error code is  (EPIPE: broken pipe), for others it is  (EPROTO: protocol error).

This error can be fixed by setting a quirk in  module (not ) for Switch controller's USB ID:

 # If you have already *manually* set quirks for other devices,
 # then do not forget to include them in the two commands below ↓
 echo -n "057e:2009:ik" | sudo tee /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/quirks

 # Optionally constant polling mode:
 sudo modprobe -r usbhid ; sleep 4 ; sudo modprobe -v usbhid "quirks=0x057e:0x2009:0x400"

 are 2 flags (List of all flags).

The flag  means "allow bad descriptors".

And the flag  means "disable LPM" (link power management). It is specified in the command because it often helps devices of other types. This flag might do nothing because not all USB controllers even have LPM. You can try without  aftewards.

You could also try the flag  ("200 ms pause after reading the descriptors") because it often helps devices of other types, but at least in the case of iPEGA PG-SW038C (a $10 gamepad) flag  causes it infinitely reconnect.

Note that once the gamepad downgrades to the fallback mode, it will never change its mode until you reconnect it. Even  doesn't work. And that's why passing the gamepad to a Windows VM would not help;  inits USB devices before passing them to a VM.

Now reconnect the gamepad, it should be finally listed now as  when you run . If that's true, then you can make this quirk permanent by add this option to GRUB:

along with (optionally)  which stops the pointless blinking of LEDs when the gamepad is unused.

Now that your gamepad is in Switch mode, you will run into a problem of SDL2 deciding to become a user-space driver (for this it uses , just like xboxdrv), which causes any SDL2 game to claim the whole gamepad (that is:  and  disappear, yet it is still possible to play this launched game with the gamepad), so you cannot use the gamepad in multiple apps anymore.

This can be fixed by adding

 SDL_HIDAPI_DISABLE_LIBUSB=1

into , and rebooting.

If you have , then delete it, because it is useless for such Switch-like gamepads, moreover  has a  rule that disallows Steam to provide its own user-space driver.

Unlike SDL2 (when it uses  which is its preferred way in 2023),  and  provide incorrect values for the right stick's X axis (it is always ≤0). Probably a bug in  or something. For this reason  is unusable in most games when in Switch mode.

You can test your gyroscope and accelerometer by launching . They are not available in other gamepad modes when connected wired because their values are sent mixed with other event data (RX/RY/etc) in a special format that is not fully compatible with  and .

If you see in  that  is used by your gamepad, then it is probably because you have built Linux kernel with your own config without . Unfortuately, Switch mode +  is as useless as the fallback mode (even no vibration).

## Xbox 360 Controller mode
After having completed everything above (i.e. 1-2 quirks, 1 envvar),

add

 blacklist hid_nintendo

into

then run  to rebuild  (kernel reads  only from its own initramfs, not your rootfs)

Now create the following file:

{{hc|1=/etc/udev/rules.d/10-disallow-generic-driver-for-switch.rules|2=
# If
# 1. a gamepad is multi-mode (Switch, X360, PC) and defaults to USB ID 057e:2009
# AND at the same time
# 2. `hid-nintendo` module cannot be loaded (blacklisted or not compiled)
# AND at the same time
# 3. there is already a launched game that immediately grabs a gamepad,
#
# Then when you connect such gamepad, it will stay in "Switch Pro" mode,
# but using the fallback `hid-generic` module
# which would result in no vibration/etc
# despite still being listed as a "Switch Pro Controller".

# But by notifying the gamepad that we abandon to use it as an HID,
# it automatically downgrades to "Xbox 360 Controller" mode,
# which causes vibration and `xboxdrv` to work.
SUBSYSTEM=="hid", DRIVER=="hid-generic", ATTRS{idVendor}=="057e", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2009", RUN="/bin/sh -c 'echo $id:1.0 > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usbhid/unbind'"
}}

then run

Since you probably do not want to reboot, run

From now on, to switch ("downgrade") from Switch mode to Xbox 360 mode, just run  (you do not even need to reconnect it). Within 2 seconds you will have  in

And if you want to switch vice versa:

#  (even though it is blacklisted, this command still works because blacklisting just means "do not load this module automatically").
# Reconnect.

## Alternative rootless solution
If you do not have root access, then:

# Power off your PC (not just suspend)
# Reconnect your gamepad.
# Power the PC on.
# UEFI (just like non-virtualized Windows) automatically and successfully initializes the gamepad (even if it is connected through a USB hub in your monitor) despite the invalid descriptors.
# The gamepad receives info from UEFI (or maybe GRUB) that it is no longer needed as an HID, which causes it to switch ("downgrade") to Xbox 360 Controller mode. Switching between modes is done this way: the gamepad disconnects, then connects under a different USB ID.
# You can even suspend (without turning off the monitor if that's what it is connected to) and then wake-up the PC, and it will still be in Xbox 360 Controller mode. But if you reconnect the gamepad, it will be in the fallback mode, so you will have to follow the instruction again.

## USB debugging
You will probably not need to know this, but this USB ID () was discovered by USB debugging:

 # Allow debugging of the kernel:
 sudo ls /sys/kernel/debug/usb >/dev/null 2>&1 || sudo mount -t debugfs none_debugfs /sys/kernel/debug
 # Load the module that allows sniffing of the traffic of USB buses:
 sudo modprobe usbmon
 # We need only connection events, and in these events
 # we need only a USB ID which is in the pre-pre-last column:
 sudo /bin/grep --line-buffered -Po '(?<=0 0 18 = .{18}).{8}' /sys/kernel/debug/usb/usbmon/99999u | /bin/sed -E 's/(where  must be replaced with the USB Bus number that your gamepad uses, e.g.  (without leading zeroes). It can be found by running .

If nothing helped and your gamepad still works in full capacity only in Windows, you can catch USB messages while in Windows, and then replay them while in Linux. See [https://github.com/JohnDMcMaster/usbrply usbrply. For this, Windows must not be in a virtual machine because Linux kernel's  initializes a USB device before passing it to a virtual machine. This could be avoided by buying a PCIe USB controller and passing it through (External USB hubs cannot be passed through). Or you can pass-through your motherboard's own USB controller if it is in a IOMMU group without devices important for you:

{| role="presentation" class="wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed"
! Script which lists IOMMU groups
|-
| {{hc|list-iommu-groups.sh|
#!/bin/bash
shopt -s nullglob
for g in $(find /sys/kernel/iommu_groups/* -maxdepth 0 -type d | sort -V); do
  echo "IOMMU Group ${g##*/}:"
  for d in $g/devices/*; do
      echo -e "\t$(lspci -nns ${d##*/})"
  done;
done;}}
|}

## Example xboxdrv configurations
To give these devices a persistent name, set an udev rule in this format.

{{hc|/etc/udev/rules.d/99-btjoy.rules|2=
#Create a symlink to appropriate /dev/input/eventX at /dev/btjoy
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="input", ATTRS{name}=="Bluetooth Gamepad", ATTRS{uniq}=="00:17:02:01:ae:2a", SYMLINK+="btjoy"
}}

Replace "Bluetooth Gamepad" with your device name and "00:17:02:01:ae:2a" with your device's address.

When you have the configuration and your device is connected you can start  like so:

 # xboxdrv --evdev /dev/btjoy --config .config/xboxdrv/ipega.conf
