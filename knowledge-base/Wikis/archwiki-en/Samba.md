# Samba

Samba is the standard Windows interoperability suite of programs for Linux and Unix. Since 1992, Samba has provided secure, stable and fast file and print services for all clients using the SMB/CIFS protocol, such as all versions of DOS and Windows, OS/2, Linux and many others.

To share files through Samba, see #Server section; to access files shared through Samba on other machines, please see #Client section.

## Server
## Installation
Install the  package.

Samba is configured in the  configuration file, which is extensively documented in .

Because the  package does not provide this file, one needs to create it before starting .

A documented example as in  from the Samba git repository may be used to setup .

## Enabling and starting services
To provide basic file sharing through SMB, enable/start . See  for details.

If you want to make your server accessible via NetBIOS host name, set the desired name in the  option in  and enable/start . See  for details.

## Make the server discoverable
Install the  package, then enable/start  to make the samba server discoverable with Zeroconf. It should work for most non-Windows file managers (macOS Finder, various GUI-based file managers on Linux & BSD etc.)

If  is not running, the server will still be accessible, just not discoverable, i.e. it will not show up in file managers, but you can still connect to the server directly by IP or domain.

Instead of installing the  package, systemd-resolved provides similar Zeroconf functionalities. Ensure its support for mDNS is enabled:

And then create a file that defines a network service. See .

Run  as root to apply changes.

Using the systemd implementation works around a bug in Avahi that causes hostnames to be unstable (Avahi#Hostname changes with appending incrementing numbers).

Windows Explorer relies on the WS-Discovery protocol instead; see #Windows 1709 or up does not discover the samba server in Network view.

## Configure firewall
If you are using a firewall, do not forget to open required ports (usually 137-139 + 445). For a complete list, see Samba port usage.

## UFW Rule
A Ufw App Profile for SMB/CIFS is included by default with the default installation of UFW in .

Allow Samba by running  as root.

If you deleted the profile, create/edit  and add the following content:

 title=LanManager-like file and printer server for Unix
 description=The Samba software suite is a collection of programs that implements the SMB/CIFS protocol for unix systems, allowing you to serve files and printers to Windows, NT, OS/2 and DOS clients. This protocol is sometimes also referred to as the LanManager or NetBIOS protocol.
 ports=137,138/udp|139,445/tcp

Then load the profile into UFW run  as root.

Then finally, allow Samba by running  as root.

## firewalld service
To configure firewalld to allow Samba in the home zone, run:

 # firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service={samba,samba-client,samba-dc} --zone=home

The three services listed are:

* : for sharing files with others.
* : to browse shares on other machines on the network.
* : for Samba/Active Directory domain controller.

 ensures the changes remain after  is restarted.

## Basic configuration
## User management
The following section describes creating a local (tdbsam) database of Samba users. For user authentication and other purposes, Samba can also be bound to an Active Directory domain, can itself serve as an Active Directory domain controller, or can be used with an LDAP server.

## Adding a user
Samba requires a Linux user account - you may use an existing user account or create a new one.

Although the user name is shared with Linux system, Samba uses a password separate from that of the Linux user accounts. Replace  with the chosen Samba user account:

 # smbpasswd -a samba_user

Depending on the [https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/manpages-3/smb.conf.5.html#SERVERROLE server role, existing File permissions and attributes may need to be altered for the Samba user account.

If you want the new user only to be allowed to remotely access the file server shares through Samba, you can restrict other login options：

* disabling shell -
* disabling SSH logons - edit , change option

Also see Security for hardening your system.

## Listing users
Samba users can be listed using the  command:

 # pdbedit -L -v

## Changing user password
To change a user password, use :

 # smbpasswd samba_user

## Creating an anonymous share
1. Create a Linux user which anonymous Samba users will be mapped to.

 # useradd guest -s /usr/bin/nologin

2. Add the following to :

Anonymous users will now be mapped to the Linux user  and have the ability to access any directories defined in , which is configured to be  in the example above.

Make sure that the Linux user  has the proper permissions to access files in .

Also, make sure shares have been properly defined as per the Share Definitions section of smb.conf.default.

## Advanced configuration
## Enable symlink following
Then, restart .

## Enable server-side copy for macOS clients
Server-side copy eliminates the need to transfer data between the server and the client when copying files on the server. This is enabled by default, but it doesn't work with macOS clients. If you have macOS clients, you need to add the following configuration to  and then restart .

## Enable Usershares
Usershares is a feature that gives non-root users the capability to add, modify, and delete their own share definitions. See .

# Create a directory for usershares:
# Create a user group:
# Change the owner of the directory to  and the group to :
# Change the permissions of the  directory so that users in the group  can create files. This command also sets sticky bit, which is important to prevent users from deleting usershares of other users:

Set the following parameters in the  configuration file:

Add the user to the sambashare group. Replace  with the name of your user:

 # gpasswd sambashare -a your_username

Restart  and  services.

Log out and log back in.

If you want to share paths inside your home directory you must make it accessible for the group others.

In the GUI, you can use Thunar or Dolphin - right click on any directory and share it on the network.

In the CLI, use one of the following commands, replacing italic sharename, user, ... :

 # net usershare add sharename abspath [user:{R|D|F} # net usershare delete sharename
 # net usershare list wildcard-sharename
 # net usershare info wildcard-sharename

## Set and forcing permissions
Permissions may be applied to both the server and shares:

See  for a full overview of possible permission flags and settings.

## Restrict protocols for better security
Append  and  in  to force usage of a minimum and maximum protocol:

See  in  for an overview of supported protocols. For compatibility with older clients and/or servers, you might need to set  or  to an older protocol, but please note that this makes you vulnerable to exploits.

Clients using  may need to specify the correct , e.g.:

 # mount -t cifs //SERVER/sharename /mnt/mountpoint -o username=username,password=password,iocharset=utf8,vers=3.1.1

See  for more information.

## Use native SMB transport encryption
Native SMB transport encryption is available in SMB version 3.0 or newer. Clients supporting this type of encryption include Windows 8 and newer, Windows server 2012 and newer, and smbclient of Samba 4.1 and newer.

To use native SMB transport encryption by default, set the  parameter globally and/or by share. Possible values are ,  (default value), , or :

To configure encryption for on the client side, use the option .

See  for more information, especially the paragraphs Effects for SMB1 and Effects for SMB2.

## Disable printer sharing
By default Samba shares printers configured using CUPS.

If you do not want printers to be shared, use the following settings:

## Block certain file extensions on Samba share
Samba offers an option to block files with certain patterns, like file extensions. This option can be used to prevent dissemination of viruses or to dissuade users from wasting space with certain files. More information about this option can be found in .

## Improve throughput
The default settings should be sufficient for most users. However setting the 'socket options' correct can improve performance, but getting them wrong can degrade it by just as much. Test the effect before making any large changes.

Read the  man page before applying any of the options listed below.

The following settings should be appended to the  section of .

Setting a deadtime is useful to stop a server's resources from being exhausted by a large number of inactive connections:

 deadtime = 30

The usage of sendfile may make more efficient use of the system CPU's and cause Samba to be faster:

 use sendfile = yes

Setting min receivefile size allows zero-copy writes directly from network socket buffers into the filesystem buffer cache (if available). It may improve performance but user testing is recommended:

 min receivefile size = 16384

Increasing the receive/send buffers size and socket optimize flags might be useful to improve throughput. It is recommended to test each flag separately as it may cause issues on some networks:

 socket options = IPTOS_LOWDELAY TCP_NODELAY IPTOS_THROUGHPUT SO_RCVBUF=131072 SO_SNDBUF=131072

## Enable access for old clients/devices
Latest versions of Samba no longer offer older authentication methods and protocols which are still used by some older clients (IP cameras, etc). These devices usually require Samba server to allow NTMLv1 authentication and NT1 version of the protocol, known as CIFS. For these devices to work with latest Samba, you need to add these two configuration parameters into  section:

 server min protocol = NT1
 ntlm auth = yes

Anonymous/guest access to a share requires just the first parameter. If the old device will access with username and password, you also need the add the second line too.

## Enable Spotlight searching
Spotlight allows supporting clients (e.g. MacOS Finder) to quickly search shared files.

Install and start/enable OpenSearch. Install , configure the directories you want to index in , and start/enable  for periodic indexing.

Edit  as described in the [https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Spotlight_with_Elasticsearch_Backend#Samba Samba wiki to enable Spotlight per share, and restart  to apply the changes.

## Client
Install  for an -like command line interface. See  for commonly used commands.

For a lightweight alternative (without support for listing public shares, etc.), install  that provides .

Depending on the desktop environment, GUI methods may be available. See #File manager configuration for use with a file manager.

## List public shares
The following command lists public shares on a server:

 $ smbclient -L hostname -U%

Alternatively, running  will show a tree diagram of all the shares. It uses broadcast queries and is therefore not advisable on a network with a lot of computers, but can be helpful for diagnosing if you have the correct sharename. The  () option suppresses the password prompt.

## NetBIOS/WINS host names
Samba clients handle NetBIOS host names automatically by default (the behavior is controlled by the  option in ). Other programs (including ) typically use Name Service Switch, which does not handle NetBIOS by default.

The  package provides a libnss driver to resolve NetBIOS host names. To use it, install it along with the  package (which provides the winbindd daemon), start/enable  and add  to the  line in :

Now, during host resolving (e.g. when using  or just ), winbindd will resolve the host name by sending queries using NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS, also known as WINS) protocol.

By default it sends a broadcast query to your local network. If you have a WINS server, you can add  to  and restart , then winbindd and other Samba clients will send unicast queries to the specified IP.

If you want to resolve your local host name (specified in the  option in ), start/enable , which will handle incoming queries.

You can test WINS resolution with . By default it sends broadcast queries to your local network regardless of the  option.

Note that WINS resolution requires incoming traffic originating from port 137.

## Disable NetBIOS/WINS support
When not using NetBIOS/WINS host name resolution, it may be preferred to disable this protocol:

Finally disable/stop .

## Manual mounting
Mount the share using  as . Not all the options listed below are needed or desirable:

 # mount --mkdir -t cifs //SERVER/sharename /mnt/mountpoint -o username=username,password=password,workgroup=workgroup,iocharset=utf8,uid=username,gid=group

The options  and  corresponds to the local (e.g. client) user/user group to have read/write access on the given path.

*  — The server name.
*  — The shared directory.
*  — The local directory where the share will be mounted.
*  — See  for more information.

## Storing share passwords
Storing passwords in a world readable file is not recommended. A safer method is to use a credentials file instead, e.g. inside :

For the mount command replace  with .

The credential file should explicitly readable/writeable to root:

 # chown root:root /etc/samba/credentials
 # chmod 700 /etc/samba/credentials
 # chmod 600 /etc/samba/credentials/share

## Automatic mounting
## Using NetworkManager and GIO/gvfs
NetworkManager can be configured to run a script on network status change. This script uses the gio command so that it mounts the Samba shares automatically, the same way your file manager does, as explained below. The script also safely unmounts the Samba shares before the relevant network connection is disabled by listening for the  and  events. Make the script executable after creating it.

Create a symlink inside  to catch the  events:

 # ln -s /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/30-samba.sh /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/pre-down.d/30-samba.sh

## As mount entry
This is a simple example of a  mount entry that requires authentication:

## As systemd unit
Create a new  file inside , e.g. . See  for details.

 path to share

 path to mount the share

 share mounting options

To use , start the unit and enable it to run on system boot.

## automount
To automatically mount a share (when accessed, like autofs), one may use the following automount unit:

Disable/stop the  unit, and enable/start  to automount the share when the mount path is being accessed.

## smbnetfs
First, check if you can see all the shares you are interested in mounting:

 $ smbtree -U remote_user

If that does not work, find and modify the following line
in  accordingly:

 domain master = auto

Now restart  and .

If everything works as expected, install .

Then, add the following line to :

 user_allow_other

Now copy the directory  to your home directory:

 $ cp -a /etc/smbnetfs/.smb ~

Then create a link to :

 $ ln -sf /etc/samba/smb.conf ~/.smb/smb.conf

If a username and a password are required to access some of the shared folders, edit
to include one or more entries like this:

It is also possible to add entries for specific hosts to be mounted by smbnetfs, if necessary.
More details can be found in .

If you are using the Dolphin or GNOME Files, you may want to add the following to  to avoid "Disk full" errors as smbnetfs by default will report 0 bytes of free space:

When you are done with the configuration, you need to run

 $ chmod 600 ~/.smb/smbnetfs.*

Otherwise, smbnetfs complains about 'insecure config file permissions'.

Finally, to mount your Samba network neighbourhood to a directory of your choice, call

 $ smbnetfs mount_point

## Daemon
The Arch Linux package also maintains an additional system-wide operation mode for smbnetfs. To enable it, you need to make the
said modifications in the directory .

Then, you can start and/or enable the  daemon as usual. The system-wide mount point is at .

## autofs
See Autofs for information on the kernel-based automounter for Linux.

## File manager configuration
## GNOME Files, Nemo, Caja, Thunar and PCManFM
In order to access samba shares through GNOME Files, Nemo, Caja, Thunar or PCManFM, install the  package.

Press  and enter  in the location bar to access your share.

The mounted share is likely to be present at  or  in the filesystem.

## KDE
KDE applications (like Dolphin) has the ability to browse Samba shares built in. Use the path  to browse the files. If you want to access files from on non-KDE application, you can install .

To use a GUI in the KDE System Settings, you will need to install the  package.

## Other graphical environments
There are a number of useful programs, but they may need to have packages created for them. This can be done with the Arch package build system. The good thing about these others is that they do not require a particular environment to be installed to support them, and so they bring along less baggage.

*
* LinNeighborhood, RUmba, xffm-samba plugin for Xffm are not available in the official repositories or the AUR. As they are not officially (or even unofficially supported), they may be obsolete and may not work at all.

## Tips and tricks
## Discovering network shares
If nothing is known about other systems on the local network, and automated tools such as smbnetfs are not available, you can manually probe for Samba shares.

First, install the  and  packages.

Use nmap to scan your local network to find systems with TCP port 445 open, which is the port used by the SMB protocol. Note that you may need to use  or set a custom ping scan type (e.g. ) because Windows systems are usually firewalled.

The first result is another system; the second happens to be the client from where this scan was performed.

Now you can connect to their IP addresses directly, but if you want to use NetBIOS host names, you can use  to check for NetBIOS names. Note that this will not work if NetBIOS is disabled on the server.

Regardless of the output, look for ', which shows the host with open services.

Use  to list which services are shared on these systems. You can use NetBIOS host name ( in this example) instead of IP when available. If prompted for a password, pressing enter should still display the list:

## Remote control of Windows computer
Samba offers a set of tools for communication with Windows. These can be handy if access to a Windows computer through remote desktop is not an option, as shown by some examples.

Send shutdown command with a comment:

 $ net rpc shutdown -C "comment" -I IPADDRESS -U USERNAME%PASSWORD

A forced shutdown instead can be invoked by changing -C with comment to a single -f. For a restart, only add -r, followed by a -C or -f.

Stop and start services:

 $ net rpc service stop SERVICENAME -I IPADDRESS -U USERNAME%PASSWORD

To see all possible net rpc command:

 $ net rpc

## Troubleshooting
## Failed to start Samba SMB/CIFS server
Possible solutions:

* Check  on syntactic errors with .
* Set correct permissions for  and restart :

 # chmod 0755 /var/cache/samba/msg

## Permission issues on SELinux
SELinux not allow samba to access user home directories by default, to solve this, run:

 # setsebool -P samba_enable_home_dirs 1

Similarly,  and  make Samba has the ability to read or "read and write" all files.

## Permission issues on AppArmor
If using a share path located outside of a home or usershares directory, whitelist it in . E.g.:

After editing, reload the AppArmor profile:

 # apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.smbd

## No dialect specified on mount
The client is using an unsupported SMB/CIFS version that is required by the server.

See #Restrict protocols for better security for more information.

## Unable to overwrite files, permissions errors
Possible solutions:

* Append the mount option  to the  entry.
* Add  to the  section of the server's .

## Windows clients keep asking for password even if Samba shares are created with guest permissions
Set  inside the  section of :

 map to guest = Bad Password

If you are still using Samba  Enable insecure guest logons'' and enable it.
Alternatively,change the following value in the registry:

 "AllowInsecureGuestAuth"=dword:1

## Error: Failed to retrieve printer list: NT_STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL
If you are a home user and using samba purely for file sharing from a server or NAS, you are probably not interested in sharing printers through it. If so, you can prevent this error from occurring by adding the following lines to your :

Restart the samba service, , and then check your logs:

 # cat /var/log/samba/smbd.log

and the error should now no longer be appearing.

## Sharing a folder fails
It means that while you are sharing a folder from Dolphin (file manager) and everything seems ok at first, after restarting Dolphin the share icon is gone from the shared folder, and also some output like this in terminal (Konsole) output:

 ‘net usershare’ returned error 255: net usershare: usershares are currently disabled

To fix it, enable usershare as described in #Enable Usershares.

## "Browsing" network fails with "Failed to retrieve share list from server"
And you are using a firewall (iptables) because you do not trust your local (school, university, hotel) network.  This may be due to the following: When the smbclient is browsing the local network it sends out a broadcast request on udp port 137.  The servers on the network then reply to your client but as the source address of this reply is different from the destination address iptables saw when sending the request for the listing out, iptables will not recognize the reply as being "ESTABLISHED" or "RELATED", and hence the packet is dropped.  A possible solution is to add:

 iptables -t raw -A OUTPUT -p udp -m udp --dport 137 -j CT --helper netbios-ns

to your iptables setup.

For Uncomplicated Firewall, you need to add  to the end of the following line in

 IPT_MODULES="nf_conntrack_ftp nf_nat_ftp nf_conntrack_irc nf_nat_irc"

and then run the following commands as root:

 echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_helper
 ufw allow CIFS
 ufw reload

To make this change persistent across reboots, add the following line at the end of :

 net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_helper=1

## Protocol negotiation failed: NT_STATUS_INVALID_NETWORK_RESPONSE
The client probably does not have access to shares.  Make sure clients' IP address is in  line in .

Another problem could be, that the client uses an invalid protocol version. To check this try to connect with the  where you specify the maximum protocol version manually:

 $ smbclient -U  -L // -m  -W

If the command was successful then create a configuration file:

## Connection to SERVER failed: (Error NT_STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL)
You are probably passing a wrong server name to .  To find out the server name, run  on the server and look at "Transient hostname" line

## Connection to SERVER failed: (Error NT_STATUS_CONNECTION_REFUSED)
Make sure that the server has started. The shared directories should exist and be accessible.

## Protocol negotiation failed: NT_STATUS_CONNECTION_RESET
Probably the server is configured not to accept protocol SMB1. Add option  in .
Or just pass argument  to .

## Password Error when correct credentials are given (error 1326)
[https://www.samba.org/samba/history/samba-4.5.0.html Samba 4.5 has NTLMv1 authentication disabled by default. It is recommend to install the latest available upgrades on clients and deny access for unsupported clients.

If you still need support for very old clients without NTLMv2 support (e.g. Windows XP), it is possible force enable NTLMv1, although this is not recommend for security reasons:

If NTLMv2 clients are unable to authenticate when NTLMv1 has been enabled, create the following file on the client:

This change also affects samba shares mounted with mount.cifs. If after upgrade to Samba 4.5 your mount fails, add the sec=ntlmssp option to your mount command, e.g.

 mount.cifs //server/share /mnt/point -o sec=ntlmssp,...

See the  man page: ntlmssp - Use NTLMv2 password hashing encapsulated in Raw NTLMSSP message. The default in mainline kernel versions prior to v3.8 was sec=ntlm. In v3.8, the default was changed to sec=ntlmssp.

## Mapping reserved Windows characters
Starting with kernel 3.18, the cifs module uses the "mapposix" option by default.
When mounting a share using unix extensions and a default Samba configuration, files and directories containing one of the seven reserved Windows characters  are listed but cannot be accessed.

Possible solutions are:

* Use the undocumented  mount option for cifs

 # mount.cifs //server/share /mnt/point -o nomapposix

* Configure Samba to remap  ("SFM", Services for Mac) style characters to the correct native ones using fruit

* Manually remap forbidden characters using catia

The latter approach (using catia or fruit) has the drawback of filtering files with unprintable characters.

## Folder shared inside graphical environment is not available to guests
This section presupposes:

# Usershares are configured following previous section
# A shared folder has been created as a non-root user from GUI
# Guests access has been set to shared folder during creation
# Samba service has been restarted at least once since last  file modification

For clarification purpose only, in the following sub-sections is assumed:

* Shared folder is located inside user home directory path ()
* Shared folder name is MySharedFiles
* Guest access is read-only.
* Windows users will access shared folder content without login prompt

## Verify correct samba configuration
Run the following command from a terminal to test configuration file correctness:

 $ testparm

## Verify correct shared folder creation
Run the following commands from a terminal:

 $ cd /var/lib/samba/usershares
 $ ls

If everything is fine, you will notice a file named

Read the file contents using the following command:

 $ cat mysharedfiles

The terminal output should display something like this:

## Verify folder access by guest
Run the following command from a terminal. If prompted for a password, just press Enter:

 $ smbclient -L localhost

If everything is fine, MySharedFiles should be displayed under  column

Run the following command in order to access the shared folder as guest (anonymous login)

 $ smbclient -N //localhost/MySharedFiles

If everything is fine samba client prompt will be displayed:

 smb: \>

From samba prompt verify guest can list directory contents:

 smb: \> ls

If the  error is displayed, the issue is likely to be with Unix directory permissions. Ensure that your samba user has access to the folder and all parent folders. You can test this by sudoing to the user and attempting to list the mount directory, and all of its parents.

## Mount error: Host is down
This error might be seen when mounting shares of Synology NAS servers. Use the mount option  to solve it.

## Software caused connection abort
File managers that utilizes  can show the error  when writing a file to a share/server. This may be due to the server running SMB/CIFS version 1, which many routers use for USB drive sharing (e.g. Belkin routers). To write to these shares specify the CIFS version with the option . E.g.:

This can also happen after updating Samba to version 4.11, which deactivates SMB1 as default, and accessing any Samba share. You can reenable it by adding

## Connection problem (due to authentification error)
Be sure that you do not leave any space characters before your username in Samba client configuration file as follows:

The correct format is:

## Windows 1709 or up does not discover the samba server in Network view
With Windows 10 version 1511, support for SMBv1 and thus NetBIOS device discovery was disabled by default. Depending on the actual edition, later versions of Windows starting from version 1709 ("Fall Creators Update") do not allow the installation of the SMBv1 client anymore. This causes hosts running Samba not to be listed in the Explorer's "Network (Neighborhood)" views. While there is no connectivity problem and Samba will still run fine, users might want to have their Samba hosts to be listed by Windows automatically.  implements a Web Service Discovery host daemon. This enables (Samba) hosts, like your local NAS device, to be found by Web Service Discovery Clients like Windows. The default settings should work for most installations, all you need to do is start enable .

If the default configuration (advertise itself as the machine hostname in group "WORKGROUP") should be all you need in most cases. If you need, you can change configuration options by passing additional arguments to wsdd by adding them in  (see the manual page for wsdd for details).

## GNOME Files not showing Windows machines (version 1709 or up) with shared folders in Network view
See GNOME/Files#Windows machines (version 1709 or up) with shared folders don't show up in Network view.

## iOS/iPadOS Files can no longer copy-to Samba share on Arch Linux beginning with iOS/iPadOS 14.5
Beginning with iOS/iPadOS 14.5 attempting to transfer from a device running iOS/iPadOS using the "Files" app to a samba share on Arch Linux will result in the error:

 The operation couldn't be completed
 Operation canceled

To correct this problem, add add the following to the global section of your  and restart .
Comment optional:

See https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/424681 Apple.Stackexchange.com - "The operation couldn't be completed"/"Operation canceled" error message when saving to a Samba share via Files app.

## Slow initial connections from certain clients without other performance problems
Some SMB clients, such as Solid Explorer for Android, take significantly longer to connect to Samba if they fail to resolve the NetBIOS name. Enabling  will greatly speed up initial connections if this is the case. Since this is a bug in the client software, please report such cases to the authors of conflicting software.

## CUPS managed printers are not listed
When Samba is configured to use CUPS for printing

And the following symptoms occur:

*  does list any printers
*  may return tree connect failed: NT_STATUS_BAD_NETWORK_NAME
*
*  may contain the following entries.  It's possible that the latest versions of samba do not use this file anymore
 14:24:18.938740,  0 ../../source3/printing/printer_list.c:58(get_printer_list_db)
   get_printer_list_db: Failed to open printer_list.tdb

A workaround is to launch  manually (without parameters).  Consider creating a systemd service to keep the binary running until the bug is fixed

## Delayed directory updates on Windows clients
Windows clients mapping Samba shares may not immediately reflect file modifications made on the Linux server, while changes from Windows appear instantly. Restarting  temporarily resolves this.
Add  to the  section of  and restart . This disables SMB3 directory leases, which can cause caching inconsistencies for server-side changes on some configurations.
