# GNOME/Troubleshooting

## Shell freezes
In the event of a shell freeze (which might be caused by certain appearance tweaks, malfunctioning extensions or perhaps a lack of available memory), restarting the shell by pressing  and then entering  may not be possible.

In this case, try switching to another TTY () and entering the following command: . It may take a few seconds before the shell successfully restarts. On X11, restarting the shell in this fashion should not log the user out, but it is a good idea to try and ensure that all work is saved anyway; on Wayland (currently the default), restarting the shell kills the whole session, so everything will be lost.

If this fails, the Xorg server will need to be restarted either by  for console logins or by restarting  for GDM logins. Bear in mind that restarting the Xorg server will log the user out, so try to ensure that all work is saved before attempting this.

## Incorrect application defaults
When installing applications for the first time you may find that GNOME has the wrong application associated to a certain protocols - for instance, easytag becomes the folder handler instead of GNOME Files.

For GNOME Files see the following page: GNOME Files#Files is no longer the default file manager.

To query the current associated application and recommended apps for pdfs in this case run:
 $ xdg-mime query default application/pdf

To change the default app for pdfs to Document Viewer, run the following command:
 $ xdg-mime default org.gnome.Evince.desktop application/pdf

For other applications, default handler settings are detailed on the following page: Default applications.

## Search does not list any local files
In order for Gnome's localsearch tool to index your local files, they must be stored in an XDG compliant directory (such as 'Documents' or 'Music'). For more information, see XDG user directories.

You can also configure localsearch to recursively search inside specific directories. These can be specified via Settings > Search > Search locations.

## GNOME Online Accounts settings page does not show properly
In some cases, due to interactions with Alacarte (menu editor), GNOME Online accounts settings page would not show. If that happens, "Restore System Configuration" in Alacarte can restore missing functions to gnome-control-center. (See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1520431.)

## GNOME Online Accounts blank pop-up window when logging in
Some services require authentication to log in (Google, Microsoft, etc.), so in some situations (such as Nvidia drivers) the popup will go blank instead of redirecting to the login page. To solve this problem, temporarily disable WebKit Composite.
 $ WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1 gnome-control-center online-accounts

## Cannot change settings in dconf-editor
When one cannot set settings in , it is possible their dconf user settings are corrupt. In this case it is best to delete the user dconf files in  and set the settings in dconf-editor after.

## When an extension breaks the shell
When enabling shell extensions causes GNOME breakage, you should first remove the user-theme and auto-move-windows extensions from their installation directory.

The installation directory could be one of ,  or . Removing these two extension-containing folders may fix the breakage. Otherwise, isolate the problem extension with trial‑and‑error.

Removing or adding an extension-containing folder to the aforementioned directories removes or adds the corresponding extension to your system. Details on GNOME Shell extensions are available at the GNOME web site.

If you have trouble with uninstalling an extension via extensions.gnome.org/local, then probably they have been installed as system-wide extensions with the  package. Removing the package again obviously affects all user accounts.

## Extensions do not work after GNOME 3 update
Before trying the workarounds below, check if an update is available for the extension by visiting extensions.gnome.org/local.

If there is no update for your current GNOME version yet, use the following command to disable version validation for extensions:
 $ gsettings set org.gnome.shell disable-extension-version-validation true

Alternatively, you could modify the extension itself, changing the supported shell version to satisfy the version validation. See the method below.

Locate the folder where your extensions are installed. It might be  or .

Edit each occurrence of  which appears in each extension sub-folder.

{| border="0"
| Insert: ||
|-
| Instead of (for example): ||
|}

 indicates the extension works with every shell version. If it breaks, you will know to change it back.

## Keyboard shortcut do not work with only conky running
The GNOME shell keyboard shortcuts like , , and the media key shortcuts do not work if conky is the only program running. However, if another application like gedit is running, then the keyboard shortcuts work.

Solution: edit

 own_window yes
 own_window_transparent yes
 own_window_argb_visual yes
 own_window_type dock
 own_window_class Conky
 own_window_hints undecorated,below,sticky,skip_taskbar,skip_pager

## Unable to apply stored configuration for monitors
If you encounter this message try to disable the xrandr :

 $ dconf write /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/xrandr/active false

## Consistent cursor theme
See Cursor themes#Desktop environments.

## Windows cannot be modified with Alt-Key + mouse-button
In GNOME 3.6 and above, the mouse button modifier (the key that allows you to drag a window from a location other than the titlebar) is the  key instead of the  key which was used in the past. The change was made in response to the following bug report.

To change the mouse button modifier back to the  key, execute the following:
 $ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences mouse-button-modifier ''

## Slow loading of system icons/slow GDM login
Problems with the loading of system icons, such the ones in the title bar of Files, might be solved by executing the following command:
 # gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders --update-cache

Running the aforementioned command may also fix repeated occurrences of the "Oh no! Something has gone wrong!" error screen and/or very slow loading and login with GDM as described in the following forum thread.

## Artifacts when maximizing windows
Maximizing windows may cause artifacts as of GNOME 3.12.0 - see the following forum thread and bug report. A solution is detailed in the following section: #Tear-free video with Intel HD Graphics.

## Tear-free video with Intel HD Graphics
;DRI3
According to a bug report, DRI3 includes the  extension that allows GNOME Shell's Mutter compositor to sync windows to vblank in an efficient way. Since version , DRI3 is enabled by default in  ;Intel TearFree
Enabling the Xorg Intel TearFree option is a known workaround for tearing problems on Intel adapters. However, the way this option acts increases memory consumption and lowers performance, see [https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37686#c123 the original bug report's final comment.

;Mutter tweaks

GNOME Shell's Mutter compositor has a tweak known to address tearing problems (see the original suggestion for this fix and its mention in the Freedesktop bug report). To enable this tweak, append the following line to : . Then restart the Xorg server.

;Disable fullscreen unredirect
GNOME Shell does by default unredirect fullscreen applications. This may result in tearing. You can disable this with the gnome shell extension .

## Window opens behind other windows when using multiple monitors
This is possibly a bug in GNOME Shell which causes new windows to open behind others. To fix this issue, one can run the following command:
 $ gsettings set org.gnome.shell.overrides workspaces-only-on-primary false

## Lock button fails to re-enable touchpad
Some laptops have a touchpad lock button that disables the touchpad so that users can type without worrying about touching the touchpad. Currently, it appears that although GNOME can lock the touchpad by pressing this button, it cannot unlock it. If the touchpad gets locked you can run the following to unlock it:

 $ xinput set-prop "SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad" "Device Enabled" 1

## GNOME Shell keyboard sources menu not visible
A menu showing the keyboard input sources (for example 'en' for an English keyboard layout) should be visible next to the status area containing icons for network, volume and power sources. If the keyboard sources menu is not visible, this is probably because you have configured your Xorg keyboard layout in a way which GNOME does not recognise.

To ensure that the menu is visible, remove any Xorg keyboard configuration you might have created and set the keyboard locale using localectl.

Upon running the command and then logging out, you should find that the keyboard input sources menu is visible in GDM and in the GNOME Shell desktop. See Input sources in GNOME for more information.

## Mouse cursor missing
When using a separate window manager with gnome-settings-daemon, the mouse cursor may vanish. Run:

 $ gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.cursor active false

## No restart button in session menu when screen is locked
If XScreenSaver is installed, ensure that it is not running at startup, see GNOME#Autostart.

## PulseAudio system-wide causes delay in GNOME and GDM
If you are running PulseAudio in system-wide mode, the PulseAudio 7.0 upgrade breaks GDM and GNOME.
See this forum post for more information.

## GNOME crashes when trying to reorder applications in the GNOME Shell Dash
The dash is the "toolbar" that appears, by default, on the left when you click Activities. Applications can be reordered in the dash by dragging and dropping. If this fails, and/or causes GNOME to crash, try changing your icon theme.

## No H264 Video in GNOME Video Player (Totem)
See Codecs and containers#No H264, mpg4 or Musepack (.mpc) in Totem Player.

## No suspend on LID closure
GNOME defaults to this behaviour about suspension:

* No external monitor attached, computer goes in suspension when LID closes.
* External monitor attached, computer does not go in suspension when LID closes.

Currently  is not able to modify the behaviour on the second case, when a monitor is connected to the computer. While it can inhibit suspension with no monitor attached.

## gnome-shell / gnome-session crashes on session startup
Sometimes  crashes immediately after login. This might be more visible on wayland and it might seem as if every second login attempt fails. The problem can be temporarily worked around by removing the files in . A more lasting work-around is to disable the session manager's  feature:

 $ gsettings set org.gnome.SessionManager auto-save-session false

## Low OpenGL performance and stuttering
* With proprietary NVIDIA driver

This bug is much likely the cause of it. You should revert  commit in . Use ABS for this and add  to the  function in the PKGBUILD or simply install  instead.

* With free drivers

If video playback stutters (a bit), try GNOME on Xorg instead of Wayland.

## GNOME Wayland session not available
GNOME Wayland does not support more than one GPU for output yet, falling back on GNOME X11.

If your displays are only connected to one of your video devices, add this to your system environment variables:

 MUTTER_ALLOW_HYBRID_GPUS=1

See also GDM#Wayland and the proprietary NVIDIA driver.

## gnome-control-center is empty and does not list any categories
Under alternative window managers (i3 for example), gnome-control-center starts as an empty window.
You need to set the variable  to  to start it (either in a script or exporting the variable in ).

 export XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=GNOME
 gnome-control-center &

## GNOME freezes for a second after using a Function (Fn) key shortcut
This is a problem with the brazilian portuguese ABNT 2 keyboard. If you have the brazilian portuguese enabled, GNOME might experience this problem. To fix this issue and keep using this keyboard layout, un-map the scroll lock button by commenting this line at :

 modifier_map Mod3   { Scroll_Lock };

And restart the session (log out and in).

## Zoom in/out keyboard shortcuts do not work on some applications
 and  keyboard shortcuts for zoom in/out functions do not work out of the box on some GNOME applications, such as Files and GNOME Terminal.

In such cases, open up GNOME Tweaks () and navigate to Keyboard & Mouse > Additional Layout Options button > Layout of numeric keypad. Change the  value to .

## Printers configuration does not work in GNOME settings
CUPS and  should be installed

## Screen reader does not work
Install . Alternatively,  can be used

## GNOME Software does not show Arch Linux packages
 integration is voluntarily disabled and considered unsupported; see also .

## Right click does not work in touchpad
In touchpads where the buttons are divided (e.g. buttonless touchpads), tapping with one finger on the right side - or any other place - of the touchpad can give you the behavior of the left button, when right button is expected.

As of GNOME 3.28, the default behavior of touchpads is a two-finger tap emulate the mouse's right button. This behavior can be changed in GNOME Tweaks () by going in Keyboard & Mouse in the left-side menu and then Mouse Click Emulation option.

The following values are available for click method:

; Fingers : default value, two-fingers top to emulate right click button (default)
; Area : tap button-right for the right click behavior and button-middle for middle click
; Disabled : no mouse click emulation

Alternatively, this behavior can be changed in the command-line interface using gsettings. For instance, to set areas click method:

 $ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.touchpad click-method areas

## Device Security setting panel erratic behavior
See GNOME#Device Security Settings.

## Cursor size or theme issues on Wayland
The cursor settings might not be set for some Qt applications like Telegramhttps://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/issues/5894][https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop/issues/25075#issuecomment-1250020362. This may result in cursors being of the wrong theme, size and not being able to resize the window.

Set the  and  environment variables manually (e.g., ,  or ).

You can also use inline getting of current system's cursor size:
 $ XCURSOR_SIZE="$(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-size)" _executable

If mentioned variables does not work on Wayland (for example in Telegram), try also adding

## Force software rendering of GNOME
If you experience problems with your GPU driver, you can force software rendering of the GNOME session with the following environment variables:

For Wayland session:
 MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=kms_swrast

For X11 session:
 LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1
