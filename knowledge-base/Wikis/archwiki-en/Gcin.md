# Gcin

Gcin is a new generation of Chinese input method server developed by Edward Liu. Gcin supports various input methods and works under most Unix-like operating systems. It is one of the most popular Chinese input engines in Taiwan.

## Installation
Install the  package.

## Configuration
Set the following environment variables:

 GTK_IM_MODULE=gcin
 QT_IM_MODULE=gcin
 XMODIFIERS=@im=gcin
 LC_CTYPE=zh_TW.UTF-8

And configure gcin to run when the desktop starts. For example, by using xprofile:

 gcin &

## Usage
## With GNOME/GTK 2 applications
gcin provides a gtk input module, thus all gtk2-based applications are directly supported, there is no need to configure anything after installation (it is not XIM, and gcin is automatically started when needed).

## With other applications
1. Set environment locale to use UTF-8, for example:

 export LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8

2. Set XMODIFIERS:

 export XMODIFIERS=@im=gcin

gcin uses the name "gcin" by default and you can change this with the environment variable GCIN_XIM in order to run multiple gcin instances, for example:

 export GCIN_XIM=gcin_zh
 export XMODIFIERS=@im=gcin_zh

Remember that gtk2 applications start one instance of gcin automatically if it does not exist.

3. Start gcin:

 gcin &

4. Run your applications! If gcin is killed when your applications are running, it is likely to cause crash or other problems.

## Additional notes for Wine/Crossover Office
# If you run wine or Crossover Office, it is better to use Windows 2000 emulation instead of Windows 98, and you have to start gcin and wine/cxoffice with at least LC_CTYPE=zh_TW.utf8, otherwise wine will not be able to show Chinese correctly.
# In wine+IE6 with Windows 98 emulation, LC_CTYPE is not enough if you want to input Chinese on the web-pages - you have to set either LANG or LC_ALL to zh_TW.utf8, which slows down wine a lot. However, you can always type Chinese in the location bar or other places and paste it.
