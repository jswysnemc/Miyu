# NAME

dumpe2fs - dump ext2/ext3/ext4 file system information

# SYNOPSIS

**dumpe2fs** \[ **-bfghixV** \] \[ **-o superblock=*superblock*** \] \[ **-o blocksize=*blocksize*** \] *device*

# DESCRIPTION

**dumpe2fs** prints the super block and blocks group information for the file system present on *device.*

The *device* specifier can either be a filename (i.e., /dev/sda1), or a LABEL or UUID specifier: "**LABEL=***volume-label*" or "**UUID=***uuid*". (i.e., LABEL=home or UUID=e40486c6-84d5-4f2f-b99c-032281799c9d).

**Note:** When used with a mounted file system, the printed information may be old or inconsistent.

# OPTIONS

**-b**
print the blocks which are reserved as bad in the file system.

**-o superblock=*superblock***
use the block *superblock* when examining the file system. This option is not usually needed except by a file system wizard who is examining the remains of a very badly corrupted file system.

**-o blocksize=*blocksize***
use blocks of *blocksize* bytes when examining the file system. This option is not usually needed except by a file system wizard who is examining the remains of a very badly corrupted file system.

**-f**
force dumpe2fs to display a file system even though it may have some file system feature flags which dumpe2fs may not understand (and which can cause some of dumpe2fs's display to be suspect).

**-g**
display the group descriptor information in a machine readable colon-separated value format. The fields displayed are the group number; the number of the first block in the group; the superblock location (or -1 if not present); the range of blocks used by the group descriptors (or -1 if not present); the block bitmap location; the inode bitmap location; and the range of blocks used by the inode table.

**-h**
only display the superblock information and not any of the block group descriptor detail information.

**-i**
display the file system data from an image file created by **e2image**, using *device* as the pathname to the image file.

**-m**
If the **mmp** feature is enabled on the file system, check if *device* is in use by another node, see **e2mmpstatus**(8) for full details. If used together with the **-i** option, only the MMP block information is printed.

**-x**
print the detailed group information block numbers in hexadecimal format

**-V**
print the version number of **dumpe2fs** and exit.

# EXIT CODE

**dumpe2fs** exits with a return code of 0 if the operation completed without errors. It will exit with a non-zero return code if there are any errors, such as problems reading a valid superblock, bad checksums, or if the device is in use by another node and **-m** is specified.

# BUGS

You may need to know the physical file system structure to understand the output.
